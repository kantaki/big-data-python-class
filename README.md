# big-data-python-class
Source code for the big data python class

This project has been created to support the Fall 2017 "Big Data using Python"  topics class for the Computing Sciences Graduate Program of Villanova University.

The intent is to support education in the use of python to address data analysis and big data problems. 

Currently the course is under development.  Expect new items to be checked in.  If you have any suggestions for topics I will create a directory structure to allow for submissions of project requests, class homeworks, alogorithms design...

Please note any submission will be in the public domain and will be covered under the license of this site so do not submit anything that is not yours.

Theo Decker is a young man who is stricken by an existential depression after the sudden brutal death of his mother and abandonment by his father. This kind of depression is not biochemical and may be more common in the gifted student characterized by a unique sense of hopelessness and a feeling that life is without meaning. He goes through his life underachieving and trying to self medicate with alcohol and drugs. His only hope is a work of art that may keep alive, for him, the memory of his beloved mother. He is a character in the tradition of the existential philosophy that humans find meaning in life through our own choices. We are free to do that and therefore responsible for our own misery or happiness. Theo is a victum of random events, but is tied to a work of art that gives his life some chance of meaning.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u'Existential Depression'}\n",

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">It\\'s obvious Ms. Tartt had a good liberal arts education that included some Russian literature, an aquaintance with 19th century English authors, philosophy, psychology, and a working association both then and perhaps now, either firsthand or vicariously with mind altering substances.  To compare this novel to GREAT EXPECTATIONS, by Dickens, as some have done, is an insult to one of the world\\'s great authors.  Dickens had a lucid (and I stress lucid) mastery of both descriptive details and human nature, perhaps only second in the latter to Shakespeare, and while his novels were often lengthy, it must also be remembered that many of them were written in installments, which readers eagerly awaited from one section to the next. The obvious depiction of Theo to be like the protagonist in GREAT EXPECTATIONS, Pip, is glaring, extending even to giving Theo\\'s life long unrequited love interest the name Pippa.<br/><br/>Ms. Tartt mentions another lengthy novel, THE IDIOT, toward the end of the book, and while she adds Russian/Ukranian (some people insist on a differentiation) characters, the only real thing this book shares with the great Russian novels is abject misery and suffering that goes on way too long, but that was before TV and movies...people had more time to devote to reading, it was the only entertainment for many and those novels possessed intellectual integrity, a quality sadly lacking in this book.  What bothered me about this book, other than I spent too many hours wading through it, was its meandering, despondent passages that lacked clarity in the sense that the narrative was often skewed so negatively as to be almost unbelievable.  In short, the experience was laborious, and despite what many who\\'ve read the book think, I DON\\'T see this book as great literature.  Those who do need to pick up some decent reading lists of the classics.<br/><br/>The few positve influences in Theo\\'s life (Andy, Hobie,) lacked any developmental depth and the story seemed to be almost like THE PERILS OF PAULINE on mindbenders.  I was often physically exhausted and depressed by the ongoing, never-ending torture the protagonist endured. The incidence of invoking a reaction by your reader is not always a sign of good writing. The plot(s) seemed to rely heavily on random chance, which Tartt has the characters discuss toward the end of the book in an almost comically adolescent passage, along with Theo\\'s final summarizing of his personal philosopy of art/enduring beauty and standing up to life\\'s difficulties, refusing to stand back, being stalwart and brave, like the little goldfinch; the last several pages had an almost shotgun-like scattering of ruminations and what might be loosely termed as \"\"conclusions.\"\"<br/><br/>In an art textbook\\'s rendition of the artist\\'s use of trompe l\\'oeil  in the painting of The Goldfinch, amplified by somewhat fanciful theories,  Theo ascribes various reasons for the artist, Fabritius, for having done so, omitting that it was a new technique in Dutch painting popularized by another pupil of Rembrandt\\'s, Samuel Van Hoogstraten, and Fabritius might have been just dabbling with technique, as it was painted in the same year as Van Hoogstraten\\'s first trompe l\\'oeil painting.  While modern sensibilities perceive a bird chained up as a pet as being gruesome, goldfinches were commonly kept as depicted in the painting in many households of the period, thus the artist might not have attributed anything cruel to the representation.  The point of trompe l\\'oeil is to make something appear other than it is.....real, dimensional, not flat, in short, it\\'s deceptive. Much as the perceived \"\"greatness\"\" of this novel is, I would add...<br/><br/> Theo finally gets around to mentioning Hobie\\'s reference to a  quote attributed to Picasso....Hobie says, \"\"Well, I\\'m just an old copyist talking to myself. You know what Picasso says, \\'Bad artists copy, good artists steal.\\' \"\" Perhaps Ms. Tartt took this quote to heart....  but more damming, her use of this quote is just one more example of her shoddy research, use of anachronisms and psuedo-intellectualism.  For those who want to read an article that refutes Picasso\\'s coining of this phrase, go to [...]It\\'s a short article written by Nancy Prager, Esq., who took the time to research the etymology of the quote from an indisputable source.  In short, Picasso never said it.<br/><br/> What really saddens me are the 2,000 people who participated in \"\"follow the leader\"\" or \"\"group think\"\" or whatever term you want to use for those who gave this book a five star rating.

Author Donna Tartt interweaves the lives of Theo, Boris, Pippa, and Hobie and produces a novel that is both poignant and edgy.  The common thread that guides the action involves a small painting by the Dutch painter,Carel Fabritius, that has survived the explosion that destroyed much of Delft in 1674,only to be lost again as a terrorist bomb planted in the gift shop of the Metropolitan explodes in the first decade of the 2000s.  The tiny goldfinch as depicted by Fabritius is possibly the most famous bird in the history of Dutch art.  Tartt has done her research in art history, and her ability to capture and portray the underbelly of major cities reveals a depth of understanding rarely present in contemporary fiction.<br/>Liz Wildberger, Fairfield, CA</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u'Art, Antiques and Artful Dodgers'}\n",

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">Donna Tartt has managed to do something rather wonderful and the mechanism is mysterious. I had been definitely absorbed in the book, in a satisfying page turning sort of way; then there came a point when I fell inside the spell of the book - its world becoming real and textured.<br/><br/>At one and the same time I was eager to be making the continuing journey of narrative , and yet - I wanted to stay exactly where I was and savour the moment, the reality of where the characters were NOW - she had somehow stopped time for me and I was reading in a very present way, inside the world<br/><br/>Tartt managed exactly this trick with her first book The Secret History, creating something special and magical. Her second long awaited book, The Little Friend, was a huge damp squib, for this reader, her sharp intelligence and precision somehow soft: it irritated me, I disliked it.<br/><br/>But here she is again, and this one is fabulous. Set across America, primarily in New York, but also in the wide-open spaces of Nevada, in the hinterland of Las Vegas, the book opens in Amsterdam, the central character a man somehow on the run, hyped up, holed up, hiding in a hotel room, sweating, edgy, on the edge of panic. The trajectory of the book is to start him on his journey to reach that anxious opening, and then go beyond<br/><br/>The book is like a large 5 act play - and in some ways reminds me, in its structure, of Shakespeare\\'s last plays, the ones that move beyond tragedy to redemption and understanding - Winter\\'s Tale, The Tempest etc. We have a journey for the central character of the dreadful, lacking - not so much self-awareness as the discipline to manage his character flaws, a certain feckless, dark, damaged nature - and the journey is really to a better accommodation with self. Not the Hollywood journey, the, `make it all better tie the bows and open the box of chocolates journey, but the more bitter, more mature journey of better understanding, and ability to live within the flawed self, and within a flawed world.<br/><br/>I am surprised at all the references to Dickens, how like Dickens this was - for me, this connection was not there at all - where I saw Tartt inhabiting some nineteenth century place it was the Russians - and particularly Dostoeivsky.<br/><br/>Theodore Decker inhabits a dark, despairing nihilistic universe, which may not take him into such wrongdoing as Raskolnikov, but he does have extremely flexible attitudes to right and wrong - that is, not so much to how wrongdoing damages him, merely that he is not quite able to avoid making poor choices. He combines despair with a fervid appreciation of the value of art and beauty, and transcendence. Some very complex, layered depth of character.<br/><br/>Though there is of course a story, as we know from the start, connected with the mysterious Dutch painting of a goldfinch, this is not primarily the story of the painting - there is indeed a strong narrative, a very strong sense of time and place, but what Tartt is doing is exploring the complexity of character and also of ethics.<br/><br/>Her writing is beautiful, measured and potent. I particularly appreciated the change landscapes and times imposed on her language in the different sections, moving from a beautiful evocation of wintery Amsterdam, to the vibrant nature of New York (separated by a passage of time, two `acts\\' here) and the weird, frenetic Las Vegas excess and waste setting, before returning to the start, and travelling beyond, now we understand Theo\\'s journey<br/><br/>And, running like a lest-we-forget throughout, the reminder of the potent Goldfinch painting, which is both a real object, and a deeply charged, talismanic, symbolic item.<br/><br/>Here is an extract, with a flavour of her writing - gorgeous, evocative - and deadly<br/><br/>\"\"Sometimes, in the evenings, a damp, gritty wind blew in the windows from Park Avenue, just as the rush hour traffic was thinning and the city was emptying for the night; it was rainy, trees leafing out, spring deepening into summer; and the forlorn cries of horns on the street, the dank smell of the wet pavement had an electricity about it, a sense of crowds and static, lonely secretaries and fat guys with bags of carry-out, everywhere the ungainly sadness of creatures pushing and struggling to live\"\"<br/><br/>That paragraph, started, for me, to play, strongly, Gershwin\\'s Rhapsody In Blue, and just as I was comfortably in the blue melancholy, Tartt, as so often, delivered a harsh punch to the gut. She shows you beauty, and immediately nestles you up against the flip side of rot, despair, decay.<br/><br/>So, having stunned and grabbed this reader with that first book, this magical third has been waiting 20 years to grab me again with its mix of dark and light. Hope It doesn\\'t take her another 20 to produce something this fine!<br/><br/>And I am properly envious of anyone about to start reading this; enjoy the catch of Tartt\\'s carefully crafted spiders\\' web novel, hover round the edges as long as you can, I\\'m sure she will stickily, skilfully wind you in and tie you up tight ere long.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u'\"\"\"The loneliness that separates every living creature from every other living creature.

Then you realize that Camus and Voltaire already did these themes, better and in fewer pages.<br/><br/>Talk about a downer of a book.  It\\'s about the horror and meaninglessness of life no matter how much the blurb tries to make it about a man and a painting.  Tartt tries to save it at the end by rambling on in Theo\\'s voice about how there\\'s a small window for happiness at the edges of the madness of life, but for me, it didn\\'t make up for the 700+ pages of mind-numbing misery.  And truly, Theo IS a miserable character, an addict, a con man, without any self esteem or an assertive bone in his body.  His refusal and/or inability to engage with life or mature emotionally lands him in untenable situations.  He spends much of the book paralyzed - by grief, by PTSD, by his drug use, by Pippa, by his love and fear for the painting, by his inability to say no to just about everyone...the list goes on.  If nothing else, Theo is a compelling portrait of addiction and mental illness...and I was sick to death of him long before the book\\'s conclusion.  It\\'s not just him; most of the characters are borderline intolerable by the end.<br/><br/>My dislike for the story and characters is multifactorial.  The plot sometimes meanders and loses focus, only to then jump forward unexpectedly.  Tartt is a good writer with a talent for description and metaphor, but she needed an editor to trim the considerable amount of fat off of this one and streamline the flow of the story.  The sheer length of the story and amount of time you are forced to spend with the characters is a problem, because the longer you observe and interact with them as a reader, the less sympathetic and likable they become - and to be honest, most aren\\'t terribly likable to begin with.<br/><br/>I will say that I appreciated Tartt\\'s obvious love of art, which was clear in her descriptions of the painting and her linking of the goldfinch to the plot.<br/><br/>It could be that my feelings on the themes and characters are exactly what Tartt intended.  But to call this book a pleasure to read, as one of the major reviews does, is a stretch.  By page 200, it felt like a chore.  By page 784, I was annoyed that I had spent so much time on the book.  To sum up, the plot is good and Tartt\\'s talent is indisputable.  It\\'s the execution, themes, and characterization that ruined this one for me.<br/><br/>I\\'m sure in another year or two, an Oscar worthy film adaptation will be made, and I might see it, because it would tell what could have been a good story in 3 hours rather than the 33 it took me to wade through this book.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u'Does anyone have an antidepressant?'}\n",

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">This is unquestionably the best novel I have read in the past two years. Donna Tartt has written an epic saga of a boy whose life changes in a instant setting him on a course that will bind he and the Goldfinch, a painting he purloins following a terrorist-detonated explosion in the New York Museum of Modern Art. The story that ensues is replete with unexpected twists and turns, the most interesting of which include the sudden reappearance of characters that the reader might assume to have vanished from the narrative. The plot recounts some 20 plus years of mishap and adventure of 13-year-old Theo following the death of his mother in the museum attack, shifting focus from New York to Las Vegas and back to New York. During his relocations, Theo encounters several interesting characters among whom is his estranged father. But the most fascinating of Ms Tartt\\'s bevy of personalities is Boris, a Russian/Ukranian ex-pat with whom Theo establishes an unbreakable bond that endures throughout the story. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of this novel, aside from the ingenious plot, is the splendid development of virtually every character who makes an appearance.

THE GOLDFINCH has so much going for it, and so much in it, and such vivid characters that the lapses of logic and character continuity are easily washed away by Tartt\\u2019s march through time.

From there this Lamb-by-way-of-Dickens novel introduces a slew of fascinated, flawed characters, as well as locales, from the Upper East Side to the Village, to Vegas and Amsterdam.

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">When Theo Decker and his mother are caught up in a random act of terrorism, Theo\\'s life is ripped apart. The mother he idolised is dead, his father had abandoned them a year or so earlier and Theo is left at the mercy of the social welfare system. Fortunately he is taken in by the rich parents of his school friend, until his father turns up to reclaim him. This is the story of Theo\\'s growth into adulthood and simultaneous descent into a drink and drug fuelled world of cold-hearted socialites and East European criminals.<br/><br/>There\\'s about enough plot in this book to make a decent short story, or possibly it could stretch to a novella. Unfortunately Tartt has decided to drag it out for 771 pages, filled primarily with unremarkable prose and repetitive descriptions of drink and drugs binges, vomiting and hangovers, occasionally interspersed with a bit of random and unlikely violence. Sadly, I got the image in my head fairly early on that Tartt had popped into the local word shop and bought a couple of the huge economy bags rather than going for the more expensive select boxes - fewer words but more highly polished. Having bought them, she then seemed determined to use them - again and again and again.<br/><br/>The title of the book would lead an unwary reader to assume that the plot might have something to do with Fabritius\\' picture of the Goldfinch - well, it starts there and ends there, but the five or six hundred extremely tedious pages in the middle have little to do with it. In fact, there\\'s very little about anything in the book other than Theo\\'s depressed and depressing descent into his cycle of self-destruction - and unfortunately written so pedestrianly that it failed to move this reader with any emotion other than irritation and boredom.<br/><br/>Then there\\'s Boris, who becomes Theo\\'s friend in his teen years, introduces him to the wonders of drink and drugs and then...disappears for hundreds of pages, before suddenly re-appearing to help tie the thing up all nice and neatly; because that\\'s how life really works, isn\\'t it? Neat solutions and happy ever after - even if as in this case happiness consists of an acceptance of dull depression and hopelessness as the human condition. Tartt\\'s depiction of Boris is so badly done it\\'s almost (but unfortunately not quite) laughable. He goes beyond caricature to cartoon - think of every clich\\xe9 you know about Eastern Europeans, add the old chestnut of the good-hearted villain and tack on a mock accent that\\'s about as convincing as Dick Van Dyke\\'s Cockney. I\\'d love to know why, though he lived in Australia and then the US from an early point of childhood, Boris never properly mastered the language.<br/><br/>But then that\\'s not the only inconsistency. Given that Tartt spent ten years writing this, I\\'d have hoped she could have spared an hour or two to google some of her \\'facts\\'. For example, Theo apparently has an iPod in 1999 - amazing, since it didn\\'t go on the market till 2001. But his mother is even more amazing - apparently she was able to text when Theo was 10 - 1996, by my reckoning, at least 4 years before it began to be a real possibility for ordinary people. Theo worries about the \\'shoe bomber\\' at least a year before that event actually happened - psychic as well as technologically advanced. And finally, would a young man in his early twenties in the US of around 2010 really say that his girlfriend looks like Carole Lombard? Who, for those of you who are too young to remember, was a film star who died in 1942. I googled these little factlets - what a shame Tartt didn\\'t. It might have meant the book, or at least Theo\\'s voice, would have had a little more authenticity.<br/><br/>But I could probably have overlooked these inconsistencies had the plot been more interesting, or the writing less prosaic, or the whole thing about 75% shorter. There are undoubtedly some good passages here, and occasionally the writing rises to a high standard, but these positives are completely swamped by the sheer weight of nothingness that fills most of the book. Since Ms Tartt is not afraid to deal in clich\\xe9s, my advice to her - less is more. I\\'ve seen this book compared to Dickens - while Tartt has undoubtedly tried to take some elements of Great Expectations and work them into her plot, I find the comparison not just facile but vaguely insulting.

The story is very compelling from the first page to the last - you definitely want to know what happens.  But don\\'t rush.  There are so many things to absorb along the way - finely drawn characters, interlocking relationships, fantastic descriptions of real-world places, as well as meditations on the nature of art, God and one\\'s place in the universe.  There is a wonderful character in the book, Hobie, who has a workshop in his basement where he restores antiques.  It is filled with fantastic objects from all over the world, some of them priceless, others interesting, but without much monetary value.  Reading this book is like spending a long afternoon in Hobie\\'s workshop, looking at the craftsmanship in each item, soaking in the atmosphere and strange beauty and coming away feeling filled up.

Thanks to a friend for the recommendation. It\\'s philosophy, art, art history, furniture and Tartt kills off certain cretin  characters in such \"\"Kill Bill\"\" classy ways...FYI, review \"\"The Idiot\"\" before heading too far into the novel since there are so many references. Boris has to be one of the greatest \"\"sidekicks\"\" invented and the exchanges between him and Theo are always mini philosophy lessons.Then there is the Dickens/Hugo hugeness and scope.Check out the painting of \"\"The Goldfinch\"\" before starting. See what you take from it. Small and priceless...As for the tome: huge and gripping from poetry to slow reflections, to high-paced maniacal action.<br/>Oh, I had friends who could have done w/ 50 pages of personal narrative vs. 150. Told them that I read the book on Kindle and had no clue as to the length. In fact, I didn\\'t bother to check the number of pages. Yes,eventually, I wanted to slap that noxious Theo! I felt sorry for him at the introduction and double checked..no, not 9/11. There is delirious wandering, from the strong grip to his mother as well as to his drugs. Darn that Theo. I grew to dislike him and couldn\\'t find value in his stupidity. However, the love, there is the love of another,lost as he was, and their connection, Then there\\'s sweet and spoiled Kitsey. Yes, there is also the love he has for the magical appearances and timely reappearances of Boris. No?<br/>Another friend didn\\'t like the Las Vegas episode. What? Without Las Vegas, Dad, Xandra, the desert and school, Theo would never have met Boris, bonded w/ another lost boy and gone into the desert, and re-emrge w/ a \"\"useless\"\" toy dog!

The plight of a young man who faces being placed into a dreadful, foster care system?  The manner in which we become obsessed with possessions and let them control our lives?  The moral dilemma facing Theo relative both to the painting itself and an act of violence?  The effect of art on the human psyche? In the end, I\\'m afraid that the answer to my question escaped me.  Admittedly, the story is a very good one, and much of the material on art and antiques is interesting.  But I found myself skimming through tons of descriptive text looking for the story to move along.

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">(This review is by Bruce P. Grether, though my partner Tom\\'s name may appear on the linked account.)<br/><br/>The Goldfinch, is a remarkable story in which I truly lived and felt compelled to keep reading through the long narrative, though sections of the book were difficult to live through. The writing is superb throughout, and Tartt has written a totally plausible account of the emotionally walking wounded, her narrator a boy traumatized by a horrific tragedy, yet graced by the endowment of a mysterious gift, as well.<br/><br/>Though the narrator of the novel, Theo Decker, (fictionally) takes custody of the actual painting, The Goldfinch, painted by Carel Fabritius in 1654, the painting itself is not the legacy he believes it to be. In fact, he does not steal the painting in the ordinary sense, and yet to him it becomes more valuable than its incalculable \\u201cresale\\u201d value. Rather than plant too many spoilers in this review, let me simply say that Theo\\u2019s life after the initial loss his mother is challenging, sometimes tortured and even horrific. In fact, his self-destructive behavior can be an ordeal for the reader, and yet it makes sense that he would behave thus\\u2014all too much sense!<br/><br/>This is a lengthy book, at 771 pages, and yet I regretted it ending. It contains a treasure chest of choice characters with layers of plausible depth and living, breathing reality, particularly Pippa, Mrs. Barbour, Hobie, and the wild, rather dangerous though basically decent Boris. Theo\\u2019s path is circuitous and obsessive, beset with sudden catastrophes, and sometimes, coincidences, yet these are not implausible; any life fully lived has plenty of such significant unexpected connections, meetings and surprises.<br/><br/>Something I could not much identify with and often found harrowing, was the abundance of heavy drinking and drug use in much of the book, and yet in retrospect this is also understandable because of Theo\\u2019s horrific history. Curiously, his wild and crazy, beloved friend Boris has a very different attitude and response to his own traumatic history. These close friends have a relationship of admirable complexity and the kind of nuances and contradictions of behavior we actually experience. Also, though I understand why some have said the novel is somewhat \\u201cDickensian,\\u201d it exists solidly in the current world of iPhones and laptops, which gives it a sharp and even dangerous contemporary edge.<br/><br/>I definitely came to love and admire Mrs. Barbour, Hobie, and even Boris, more than Theo himself, who remained deeply flawed throughout, though he finally grew and changed somewhat eventually, if not a great deal. Something quite fascinating in retrospect is that within the \\u201creality frame\\u201d of the novel, Theo as narrator must be just as talented a writer as Donna Tartt. It\\u2019s entirely told in first person, and the concluding pages provide a succession of stunning grace notes without any phony salvation involved.<br/><br/>One more intriguing element here is the fact that the actual painting, The Goldfinch, presented with some true backstory, is also given a detailed fictional history for over a decade of its existence, a kind of alternate timeline to \\u201cthis,\\u201d and finally it provides that delicate, mysterious and profound interplay between art and life, which in lesser hands could seem trite. In fact, art and life converge perfectly here!<br/><br/>I consider this novel, like the titular painting, to be a genuine masterwork.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u'The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt: Gorgeous Prose and a Harrowing Story'}\n",

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">I first encountered Donna Tartt in the eighth grade, when my English teacher, a Donna Tartt enthusiast, told us all about a book that she had recently published. I haven\\'t reread The Little Friend since 2003, though I probably will go back and read it at some point this year, but when I heard about the release of Tartt\\'s latest book, I knew it would have to go on my list. It took me a little while to get around to actually starting it, mostly because of the mixed reviews and the length (just under 800 pages), but I should not have let either stop me. Donna Tartt\\'s novels are right up my alley - dark, a little twisted, fantastic writing, and always a compelling plot.<br/><br/>The novel begins with the main character of this bildungsroman, Theo, visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art with his mother. Two sites that Theo views that day play heavily into the directionality of the plot: the first is a young girl walking with an older gentleman and the second is a painting that he and his mother discuss. A bomb goes off causing, well, the chaos you might expect if a bomb were to go off at the Met. Theo decides to take the painting, Carel Fabritius\\' The Goldfinch that he and his mother were viewing, giving little thought to the ramifications of pilfering a priceless work. The novel from that point follows Theo as he grows up, adjusting to a vastly changed existence after the attack and maneuvering through life with an invaluable stolen painting. The young girl, Pippa, that he had seen on the day of the attack, ebbs in and out of the plot, a love interest from the moment Theo spots her.<br/><br/>The characters in this novel definitely stand out. Each is vividly written, a unique persona with quirks and flaws not duplicated; each feels real. From Theo\\'s father, an alcoholic with a gambling problem who lives in a large but basically unfurnished house in Nevada with his pill-popping, loud-mouthed girlfriend, to Boris, the Ukranian transplant, who introduces Theo to teenage life, Tartt\\'s characters carry the story. Each has multiple layers and keeps the reader curious and engaged, wanting to know more about their thoughts and rationales. There are dozens of little side stories going on, as the world spins around Theo, and the story that the author weaves is so rich that it\\'s as if any one of these characters could have their own novel.<br/><br/>Let\\'s talk a little bit about Fabritius\\' painting, because it\\'s very helpful in understanding Theo. I loved the art history tie in and the fact that the details about the artist in the novel were true. Carel Fabritius was a Dutch painter from Delft (same origin as Vermeer). He lived during the mid-1600s, was an extremely talented student of Rembrandt. He died when he was young in a gunpowder magazine explosion, which also destroyed many of his paintings. The Goldfinch is unique amidst Fabritius\\' oeuvre. It captures a living animal, as opposed to a portrait of a single human or a biblical scene. The bird is bathed in a very delicate light, perched upon a box and tethered to the wall indoors by a thin chain. The painting itself is physically very small, only about 13x9 inches, with rough brushstrokes only purportedly noticed when the viewer is close.<br/><br/>There are a number of links that can arguably be made between the main character and this painting. Firstly, the explosion that kills Fabritius himself and destroys most of his work parallels the terrorist attack that Theo experiences. One might even argue that what is left of Theo\\'s psyche after that day is somewhat like the bird, imprisoned and chained to a bleak and undefined landscape. We could even say, perhaps, that the way other characters see Theo is like observers view The Goldfinch, from afar, he is composed and complete, but up close just a mess of emotions and experiences.<br/><br/>Despite the length, the plot moves quickly as Theo travels about, from New York, to Las Vegas, to Amsterdam. Two parts of this novel bothered me enough to note. Don\\'t get me wrong, they didn\\'t make me rethink my impression as a whole, which was in the strong-like category, but each was slightly vexing. The first was Theo\\'s spiral into drugs and alcohol. This honestly was just not a topic I relate to, and I kept wanting to shake him and say \"\"get it together,\"\" always figuring that moment was coming sooner than it was.<br/><br/>The second aspect was the ending, which was not with a bang or a nice little knot, but more of a whisper. There is a surprising lack of resolution for a story that seemed to build to so much. Maybe we can chalk all that up to the post-9/11, ego-centric, and zombified reality that Tartt has created, a neat ending just would not fit in this world. I didn\\'t feel like this story needed the massive zoom-out that it had before concluding, the rehash of Fabritius, the reason for the penning of the tale, Theo\\'s ponderings on what having written all this down will mean.  To me, it felt a little like that section of Atlas Shrugged where you just keep waiting for the author to get back to the story and stop yammering on about this other stuff.<br/><br/>Putting all that aside, if you\\'re a Donna Tartt fan, of course don\\'t pass this up.  I haven\\'t read her other two novels in quite some time, so I can\\'t pass judgement on how this one stacks up in comparison. If you\\'ve never read her, well, I might recommend starting at the beginning, with The Secret History and savoring over all three. This is an author who has published once every 10 years, and each novel has some heft, but the stories all move quickly. You have to like dark motifs and twisted occurrences though, so if that\\'s not your cup of tea, you should probably run in the other direction.<br/><br/>Check out this and other great reviews at Bookasaurus dot Weebly dot Com.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u\"A Great Story (yes long, but don't let that bother you) with a Few Vexing Aspects\"}\n",

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">Is it possible to both like and dislike a book at the same time? To answer my own question: yes, it is, because that is how I feel about The Goldfinch. And that is exactly what I think makes it so great.<br/><br/>I have no idea how to succinctly summarize this book in a few sentences, but I\\'ll take a stab at it: A young Theo Decker survives a terrorist bombing at a museum, where his mother does not, and he now feels ultimately responsible for her death. Before leaving the museum after the bombing, Theo steals a painting (though not entirely with the thought of stealing on his mind) that his mother adored, and spends the rest of the novel in deep, deep agony and anxiety over the thought of getting caught with it. However, the rest of the novel also follows Theo\\'s extremely complicated life as he grows into a man, and also how he becomes involved in the dirty, gritty art-thief underworld.<br/><br/>I\\'m not sure when the last was that I was this conflicted about a book. There are pages and pages of details that could easily be removed in an annotated version (not that I\\'m suggesting there actually should be an annotated version - I don\\'t). However, the book would lack much of its character without the details - they are part of what makes this novel work so well.  Dashes, as well as all other forms of punctuation, are used a lot, and there is a  major sense of stream of consciousness that permeates Tartt\\'s writing and drags the reader along for a whirlwind of a ride. I love her style of listingHer writing is so strong and almost obnoxious at times that I wouldn\\'t disbelieve someone having a physical reaction to it. I could feel myself panicking along with Theo; I could feel my heart racing as Tartt\\'s sentences became short, hurried, and jumbled. It\\'s not a very lighthearted book, but it\\'s also not in-your-face dark. It sort of drags on in this somewhat negative, somewhat ho-hum manner.<br/><br/>The characters are also hard to love, but also hard to hate. At times, I understood Theo, but at others, I couldn\\'t stand him or figure out what was going on in his head. Deep down, Theo is simply the result of fragmented and broken childhood, struggling to make terms with himself and figure out his own life. However, he doesn\\'t really actively try to figure out his life; instead, he just goes along with the flow, letting life take him where it does. There are few instances where Theo decides that he is going to take the reins and do something his way, such as when he decides to leave Las Vegas. Even then, though, this was a direct result of other circumstances (which I will not mention so as not to add spoilers). Theo is quiet and reserved, yet also impulsive and risk-taking. All these qualities in Theo makes it hard to decide whether he is one that should be pitied for having such a difficult life, or disdained for his irresponsible and sometimes uncaring behaviour.<br/><br/>We also have Boris. Where do you start with Boris? How does one even describe him? Boris is the son of a Ukrainian man that Theo meets in Las Vegas, who soon becomes one of his closest and only friends. Boris is free-spirited. He does what he wants, when he wants; he\\'s extremely street smart, and seems to know everything, including how to get out of any sticky situation. Tartt does a really wonderful job of conveying Boris\\' accent; I swear I could actually hear that odd, English-learned-in-Australia-yet-Russian accent, and it was perfect.<br/><br/>There are so many other characters that I would love to delve into more, such as Andy, Hobie, Mrs. Barbour, Pippa, Kitsey, Xandra, and Theo\\'s father, but I will refrain myself. Theo has many, many interactions with various people, and it is through these interactions that we begin to more fully understand who Theo really is as a person. Each relationship seems to reveal a little bit more about his personality, history, or opinions, and it provides a vast amount of information about Theo\\'s character.<br/><br/>One other quick point I wanted to touch on regarding character relationships was Theo\\'s relationship with his mother was also somewhat puzzling to me. There wasn\\'t anything inappropriate, so I\\'m not implying that. But it didn\\'t seem like the normal mother and son relationship; of course, everyone\\'s relationship is different, but the way in which he reminisced and thought about their time together was displayed in an odd way. It was more like a long lost lover than a motherly relationship; he dreamed of their moments together, but not in a truly grief-stricken way. At the end, he mentions that<br/><br/>The Goldfinch is really rather haunting. Even when I put the book down, I could feel it lingering around me; I could still feel that bleak, drug-riddled mania that Theo so often had. I felt like I was constantly reading this book, and it felt as though it was taking me ages to make it through. It\\'s a depressing book. I never walked away from it feeling happy or satisfied; I felt, instead, as if I were missing something - it was an uneasy sort of feeling. That being said, it\\'s still addicting. I went through many phases where I truly enjoyed the story, and others when I just wanted it to be over. By the last 200 or so pages, I just wanted it to be over. Unnecessary plot lines and events became too much and I needed to finish this book so that I could move on with my life. At times it was difficult to remember what the plot or point of this novel was, and I could never truly decide if this novel was more about Theo and the painting, or Theo\\'s personal life and development. Despite this, Tartt\\'s prose truly does have moments of utter beauty; there are many passages and quotes that I would love to share, but I will share just one that I feel exemplifies Tartt\\'s meaningful, deep, and breathtaking style:<br/><br/>  \\u201cThat life - whatever else it is - is short. That fate is cruel but<br/>  maybe not random. That Nature (meaning Death) always<br/>  wins but that doesn\\u2019t mean we have to bow and grovel to it.<br/>  That maybe even if we\\u2019re not always so glad to be here, it\\u2019s<br/>  our task to immerse ourselves anyway: wade straight<br/>  through it, right through the cesspool, while keeping eyes<br/>  and hearts open. And in the midst of our dying, as we rise<br/>  from the organic and sink back ignominiously into the organic,<br/>  it is a glory and a privilege to love what Death doesn\\u2019t touch.\\u201d<br/><br/>I\\'ve seen quite a few people compare this book\\'s style to Dickens, and I can actually understand the reference. The wordiness, the long, long sentences, the over-exaggerated need to add extra details and information - it\\'s all there. She also takes time to explore and comment on the various social classes that inhabit the many different places Theo visits. She also takes great care in delving into the lives and details of a wide cast of characters, even those that the reader may not particularly care about. There are also a lot of orphans running around in this vast book, which is, of course, reminiscent of Dickens.<br/><br/>Honestly though, I don\\'t know who to specifically recommend this book for because it covers such a wide variety of subjects. There are drugs, art history, young boy/teen adventures, bad parents, good parents, thievery, antiques, international travel, and so much more. If you have time, patience, and a thirst for something different, then I would implore you to give The Goldfinch a chance. It is long, arduous journey, but I think you\\'ll be just as intrigued by Theo\\'s life and struggles as I was, and therefore unable to put that book down. Even when you do, it will still remain stamped in your memory, and for that reason, I feel it deserves four stars.The overarching theme that \"\"life is short\"\" is a beautiful ending to this book, and I believe that it is something that everyone can learn, and no one can ever hear too much.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u'A stunning, complicated, and at times dense book that will keep the pages turning'}\n",

I just couldn\\'t finish it.<br/><br/>Apparently I\\'m not the only one who had problems: the book only has a 3.8 out of five star rating on Amazon, which, for Amazon, is nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>However, as always, your mileage may vary. This book has won a Pulitzer Prize in fiction, and no less than Stephen King wrote a glowing review about it in the New York Times. So, you know, take what I say with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>Let\\'s briefly go over the plot. The story is about a boy named Theo Decker, born and raised in New York.<br/><br/>His father is an alcoholic who abandons him very young, leaving him with a wonderful, artistic mother who loves him and struggles to make ends meet to give him a good life.<br/><br/>Theo\\'s mother is killed in a terrorist attack on the Metropolitan museum. They weren\\'t even supposed to be there, but they were on their way to a school meeting as Theo had recently been suspended. This leads Theo to blame himself for his mother\\'s death.<br/><br/>By the way, that\\'s not a spoiler because it\\'s pretty much the first thing that happens in the book. You know, a hundred and fifty pages or so in (before this incident, NOTHING of any lasting consequence happens--an early sign that I wasn\\'t going to like this book).<br/><br/>In escaping from the wreckage of the museum, Theo, nearly delirious from the explosion, takes an invaluable painting called \"\"The Goldfinch\"\" from the rubble.<br/><br/>The novel tells the story of the next ten years of Theo\\'s life and the diverse cast of characters he interacts with.<br/><br/>These include Hobie, the kindly old furniture restorer who takes pity on him, Pippa, the young redheaded girl he\\'s madly in love with, and Boris, Theo\\'s best friend in adolescence.<br/><br/>All major moments in his life hinge around the painting he inadvertently stole and thereafter keeps secret.<br/><br/>From when his father reappears to complicate his life, to when he gets older and moves back to New York, to paraphrase Nat King Cole, \"\"the painting is the thing.\"\"<br/><br/>So this sounds good, right? Well, here\\'s the thing: this book is DENSE and LONG, in my opinion, about two or three times longer than it needed to be.<br/><br/>The print version of the book is 850 pages long, but the bare bones of the story could have been told in about 150 pages. Add in some well-written prose and character exploration, and you could have ended up with an EXCELLENT 350 page book.<br/><br/>Reading the prose in this book felt, to me at least, like sifting through a mountain of lead streaked with gold veins. There is REALLY GOOD WRITING in this book, beautiful turns of phrase and elegant wordsmithery, if you will. But, and again, this is my opinion, it\\'s buried in overwritten paragraphs that are heavy and laborious, verging on tedious.<br/><br/>While at times the book pulled me through on strength of prose, other times it was just a slog.<br/><br/>And lest you think I just don\\'t like good long-form prose, that\\'s not the case at all. I can read Dickens all day and night. But this book made Dickens look like Hemingway.<br/><br/>And I know what you\\'re thinking, \"\"Garrett, who are you to disagree with the literary opinion of Stephen King and the Pulitzer Prize...um...people? Committee?\"\" (I don\\'t know how it works).<br/><br/>I\\'m no one. I\\'m just an author and a reader, and after I\\'d read four hundred pages that felt like a thousand, I had to abandon this book.<br/><br/>I don\\'t know if you\\'ve ever seen the film Wonder Boys (if you haven\\'t, you really should) but while I was reading The Goldfinch I couldn\\'t help thinking about it.<br/><br/>Near the end of the film, Katie Holmes has a monologue about Michael Douglas\\' overwritten literary novel, describing how he went into so much boring detail about inconsequential things, that neither author nor reader had any room to breathe. Click that video thumbnail to see what I\\'m talking about.<br/><br/>In summary, I give The Goldfinch two out of five stars.<br/><br/>If you like dense, wordy, rambling prose streaked with occasional moments of sheer literary brilliance, you might enjoy it.

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">Not one to often read popular fiction, I downloaded The Goldfinch based on a quick glance at \"\"five stars\"\" and \"\"Pulitzer Prize\"\".  I was immediately gratified by the succinct language via the thought-voice of 13 year-old Theo, the central character. Then the bombing tragedy in the Museum, his mother\\'s death, his \"\"acquisition\"\" of The Goldfinch, a small and priceless painting. And  Theo wending his way toward home, alone, in profound shock, covered in blood not his own, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to Sutton Place, and no one stops him or helps, no one inquires.<br/><br/>Absurd, of course, but I was still in thrall to the eloquence of description.  At long last, by default, Theo winds up in Las Vegas in the care of a father who had abandoned him and his mother. This location comprises  an achingly long section of the book. Theo meets a Russian immigrant boy named Boris, quite wily and feral with an absentee father. The reader suffers through a shocking amount of drug and alcohol abuse by these two boys and, frankly, wonders how they\\'ve managed not to fatally o.d.  Here the story begins to degrade into the just-plain-stupid and unbelievable. One reviewer has described the book as a series of novellas and I agree. The 750-odd pages could have easily been pared down by half as so much of this saga seemed, to me, pointless. One good book, and 2 novellas which I wouldn\\'t have bothered to read.<br/><br/>Eventually Theo, now about 15, returns to New York. He begins to grow up and as he does the story takes an even sharper turn toward the ridiculous into the territory usually occupied by television soap operas. I came to hate this boy. There was no rhyme or reason for his seemingly pathological distrust of all the adults who were tasked with helping him after the tragedy. Thus he never told anybody the truth, though we, the readers, get to know his thoughts. And mere aging didn\\'t help him break that pattern as the story progressed.<br/><br/>For me, the story itself was a big disappointment saved only by the author\\'s eloquent writing.

Therefore, I was not daunted when our Florida book club chose this for the first book of next season. Some objected, and some had heard the book was not worth reading. When I began, I thought they were mistaken. What an interesting story -- at least for the first third: interesting narrator, characters, plot.<br/><br/>The middle section was less so as it wallowed in highly repetitious scenes of the drunken or drug-induced stupor of our angst-filled narrator in his stormy teens. Less would have been more, or perhaps I am just unsympathetic to the subject. Only so many gulps, sniffs and blackouts and I felt that I, too. was living through this very depressing,  tedious passage of time. Too long.<br/><br/>And then, there is the last third, the adult years,  which pick up narrative for a bit and then end with another  long, excessively long, monologue examining  guilt (a major recurring theme) and going on to speculate on the meaning (or lack of meaning) of life. Kirkus called it \"\"A long-awaited, elegant meditation on love, memory and the haunting power of art.\"\" Perhaps there are some elegant moments -- especially on art -- but all the words -- in much the same way as all the drugs -- ultimately became stultifying.

It\\'s a series of linked stories about a boy-grown-to-man named Theo, whose mother dies a terrible death while his life is spared in the same tragedy.  Through this incident, his choice to become involved with a very old painting called \"\"The Goldfinch\"\" dictates the rest of his life.  The painting is of a goldfinch chained to a little box hanging on a wall.<br/><br/> I can\\'t tell you how many times I felt like that bird.  While I deeply admire Ms Tartt\\'s crazy-good descriptive talents and ability to get into the mind of everyone from Theo himself, to his selfish father to a self-absorbed but caring woman, to a thirteen year old Russian boy/man - not to mention her knowledge of New York, Las Vegas, Amsterdam, antiques, drugs, the underworld of Russian immigrants and American addicts, and not least, art---I felt at times like I was drowning in words.  Sometimes I felt chained to the story (\"\"I want to fly away, I want to land somewhere else, where the story continues and I don\\'t have to wade through all these words\"\") - but because Ms Tartt is so talented, I read every word.  Now that I\\'m done with the book, I realize I could have skimmed some of the more introspective battles Theo has with himself. They got fairly repetitive, especially when he was doing drugs or trying to come to terms with his feelings about Boris, or the painting, or Pippa.<br/><br/>But all in all, the hold the chain has on the Goldfinch is the hold the painting has on Theo is the hold the book had on me.

I\\'m the one to blame for reading it, because I was the one who suggested it for my book club. And the reason I suggested it was that for every book I bought on Amazon it came up as a recommendation for me to read. Then I saw it got the Pulitzer Prize and that pushed me over the edge to want to read it. A typical 400+ page book, that I like, will take me a week to read, this book took me six weeks. It wasn\\'t really the length that made it so slow it was the way it was written. There were just pages, upon pages, upon pages of thoughts and descriptions. And yes I did appreciate the wonderful, well thought out, and very illustrative writing, but it was just too much crammed in-between the pivotal actions of the characters. It meandered too much. It had too much dead space that was filled with wandering thoughts.<br/><br/>Don\\'t get me wrong at the core this books tells a very interesting story. The key events and primary actions that happen around Theo are gut wrenching and incredibly compelling. But there is so much else that\\'s thrown into the story line that the brunt of all those powerful things is dulled by mess around them.<br/><br/>And then there is the very dark world view. You just can\\'t come away from this book feeling great. There is so much guilt, drugs, illicit behavior, and corrosive thoughts that you come away thinking the world is just a horrible place where we\\'re all just putting in time before we die and the only way we can transcend our experience is to create a work of art that outlives us. And that is just way too dark, way to tragic, and way too horrible a way to think.<br/><br/>I appreciate the tremendous amount of work that went into writing this book. I know it had to be an emotionally draining experience for Donna Tart, but it\\'s really hard for me to recommend the Goldfinch because I didn\\'t walk away excited about the writing as much as I did disappointed in its view of the human condition.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u'A great story buried in a mess of wandering thoughts'}\n",

Boris provides some wonderful moments of levity, but is a bit far fetched.  I didn\\'t know what to make of the Theo character.  The scenes after his mother dies, when he shuns help from social workers and psychiatrists ring true and give the reader an intimate understanding of this young boy\\'s internal suffering, as does the wonderful, touching scene when he first meets Hobie. This section of the book is brilliant and so beautifully written. But after that Theo\\'s character doesn\\'t seem cohesive.<br/><br/> I didn\\'t mind the length.

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">Donna Tartt\\u2019s novel certainly merits the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, but does have some discernible flaws (we will discuss later). I saw the CBS interview with Donna Tartt and now understand why her prose is so impeccable. She takes ten years to write a book! She wrote one novel each at the ages of 29, 39 and 49. She is influenced by the writing style of Charles Dickens, which accounts for the incredible descriptive writing she did throughout the novel. The aftermath of the museum explosion extends for a suspense filled eighteen pages (31-48). We see the outcome of the detonation through the eyes of our narrator and protagonist, Theo Decker. This was one of several sections the author wrote that I thought was exceptionally proficient. I also thought introducing Fyodor Dostoyevsky\\u2019s 1868 novel, \\'The Idiot\\' was a clever writer\\u2019s ploy since the Russian novel is a classic study of the conflict between good and evil, which abounds in Tartt\\u2019s novel. Lastly, this might seem trite, but I loved the author\\u2019s generous use of commas, semi colons and dashes. I know that there are grammatical rules for their usage, but I like \\u2018a little extra cheese on my pizza\\u2019 (is that a idiom?). What is the story about?<br/><br/>Okay, Theo Decker is a thirteen year old student living in N.Y.C., who gets into dubious trouble in school and gets suspended. Now his estranged mom and Theo head for the school for a meeting. They are early, it\\u2019s raining, so they duck into an art museum to pass some time and see the Dutch artist exposition, mainly Rembrandt\\u2019s The Anatomy Lesson and C. Fabritius\\u2019s The Goldfinch. Theo is mesmerized with a red headed girl (Pippa) his age accompanied by a old man presumed to be her grandfather (Welty). As Theo and his mom walk to the gift shop, mom decides to go back to see the painting one more time, leaving Theo in the shop alone when he spots the girl and her companion again. Just as he approaches the girl, a massive explosion occurs in the museum. He is covered in debris and disoriented. He hears the old man groaning and goes to him. The girl is nowhere to be seen. The old man is dying. Where is mom? The old man spots \\u201ca dusty rectangle of board\\u201d covered in rubbish and wants Theo to get it. My God, it\\u2019s The Goldfinch painting. The old man (Welty Blackwell) wants to know where Pippa is. Theo doesn\\u2019t see her (why am I using so many short sentences?). He gives Theo his \\u201cheavy gold ring with a carved stone\\u201d and tells him to take it to: Hobart and Blackwell. \\u201cRing the green bell.\\u201d Theo finally finds his way out of the museum, dazed and hurt, unable to get anyone to help him. He still has the painting. He walks home in the rain to wait for his mom to return from the museum. Guess what, she\\u2019s dead and suddenly Theo is alone.<br/><br/>Is Theo going to experience the same problems that Pip in the Charles Dickens novel, \\'Great Expectations\\' endured? Maybe. Mom doesn\\u2019t come home, a social worker from the Department of Child and Family Services calls and the story is off and running (idiom alert). The reader is going to encounter the peculiar Barbour family, agonize over Theo\\u2019s life with his dad in Las Vegas, meet his crazy Russian friend, Boris, and delight in Theo\\u2019s relationship with Hobart (Hobie). What happened to Pippa? And what about The Goldfinch? Who has it and what will become of it? It is the focus of the story, yet the author occasionally seems to forget about it for a hundred pages, or so. I guess that can happen in a 771 page novel. The cigarette smoking, vodka drinking, and drug using Boris is a character that the reader loves and periodically hates. The author has the unique ability to make the reader like the characters she wants you to like (Theo, Hobie, Pippa, Mrs. Barbour, Andy and sometimes Boris) and hate the characters she wants you to hate (Theo\\u2019s dad, Boris\\u2019s dad, Lucius Reeves, Tom Cable and sometimes Boris). Can this lady write, or what?<br/><br/>Alright, now for the flaws. When the reader gets to page 643... suddenly it\\u2019s a race to the finish line, the author can\\u2019t wait to get to page 771. Why? The novel was plodding along nicely for 642 pages and probably nine years of Donna Tartt\\u2019s life. If you are writing a book that long, what difference does it make if the novel is a couple hundred pages longer? The extra pages would have given the author the time needed to develop all the new characters that turned up near the end. Lastly, what was that life and death tirade (in the last five pages) all about? Don\\u2019t get me wrong, I loved the book...it\\u2019s just that it could have been better.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u\"Donna Tartt's novel certainly merits the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, but...\"}\n",

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">Polly Want a Cracker?<br/>By Bob Gelms<br/> As a rule I hate 800 page books. I\\u2019ve only read a few that warranted that kind of length. Mostly I find them about 200 to 300 pages too long. However, I have also read 400 page books that were 400 pages too long! Luckily, this time the 800 page book is The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt. Although some of her descriptive passages run a little long, the book is so well written I didn\\u2019t mind too much. The Goldfinch is simply a terrific book.<br/> This is Ms. Tartt\\u2019s third novel and it\\u2019s been 11 years since that last one. With her first two books being critical and financial successes, The Goldfinch was anticipated quite as if it was a literary event, which, of course, it was.<br/> It follows the adventures of Theo Decker who is in High School when he and his mother are caught in an explosion in the Museum of Art. They went there to kill some time but also to see a painting by the Dutch Master Fabritius called The Goldfinch. Something extraordinary happens during this catastrophe and Theo finds himself in possession of a mysterious ring and Fabritius\\u2019 painting which he smuggles out of the museum amidst all the chaos and that\\u2019s just in the first 75 pages. The ring and the painting brings Theo into contact with all sorts of people including but not limited to a fellow student and a Russian named Boris. I have to tell you that Boris is such an interesting character that he almost steals the book from Theo. Boris could easily have a novel of his own. He is Theo\\u2019s best friend but he\\u2019s the kind of friend you want to punch in the mouth most of the time. Boris is so charming he gets away with murder, almost literally.<br/> The Goldfinch reads a lot faster than the 800 page length would indicate. It\\u2019s so good that I planned my days around reading it in two or three sessions a day. I liked this book so much that I blew off watching a Blackhawks Hockey game to read the final 100 pages. That\\u2019s a very big deal for me.<br/> This book reminded me a lot of Charles Dickens. If it had been written in Victorian English it would have given ole\\u2019 Charlie a run for his money. Just as I was having second thoughts about that, up pops a character named Pippa, Pip or Pips for short. Theo then is reading Great Expectations. That\\u2019s a little too much to ignore. Just like in any good Dickens novel. You have characters that turn out to be something other than they seem, lots of cliff hangers, and a young protagonist who grows to adulthood learning all kinds of lessons both good and bad. Even Theo doesn\\u2019t turn out like I expected. This is one great book and I had a great time reading it even though it took me week to do so.<br/> I have read two books in a row now that I can say are the best of 2013, The Yellow Birds, and The Goldfinch. I\\u2019m giving The Goldfinch my highest recommendation.<br/>JAMES PATTERSON ALERT<br/> Well, James Patterson is at it again, trying his best to squeeze as much money out of his readers as possible. This time he is using his most famous character, Alex Cross, to suck some of your disposable income right out of your pocket and he is doing it in a most outrageous way.<br/> The new Alex Cross book is called Cross My Heart. Cross, apparently meets his match, a criminal mastermind, like that\\u2019s never happened before. Cross\\u2019 family is in danger as well. After 450 pages you are told that you have to buy another book to see how the first one ends. There is no conclusion to Cross My Heart. It is a \\u201cTo Be Continued\\u201d situation. It has no ending. You are left hanging having to shell out another $15 or $20 to see how everything turns out. I was done with James Patterson a while ago now I think I\\u2019m done with Alex Cross as well. I noticed on Amazon that the Kindle edition is $1.99 but even that won\\u2019t get me to buy it.

The author artfully combines extraordinary events and characters - Boris the Russian drug dealer, Theo\\'s deadbeat dad and his Vegas girlfriend, Hobie the antique conservator and the up tight Upper East Side Barbours (to list just a few)- and weaves them together to create a believable and vividly entertaining plot.

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">If reading fiction is an escape from reality, I\\u2019m having trouble big-time with re-entry. It\\u2019s been over a week since I finished The Goldfinch, yet the book is still one of the first things I think of in the morning and that I return to several times during the day. Somewhere around page two- or three hundred I took up residence in the rich and crowded world created by Donna Tartt, and I\\u2019ve yet to move out. (\\u201c...with very great paintings it\\u2019s possible to know them deeply, inhabit them almost...\\u201d \\u2014from The Goldfinch.)<br/><br/>The Goldfinch however, is no escape: it thrusts us into a merciless awareness that the only way out of our troubled lives is death, a truth most of us tend to avoid. When forced to face it, our reactions can range from depression to anger to thoughts of suicide (as in might as well get it over with). I don\\u2019t know if this was Tartt\\u2019s intention, but it was, at least for me, the novel\\u2019s ultimate point. Not that she doesn\\u2019t offer glimmers of joy and hope along the way, particularly in her long summary-like ending: it\\u2019s just that the dark side overpowers the light.<br/><br/>A plot-driven novel, The Goldfinch is full of twists and turns and moments of nearly unbearable suspense. Unlike most plot-driven books, however (see John Grisham, James Patterson, Nora Roberts, et al), in which the action is fueled by stereotypical cardboard characters, The Goldfinch is populated by realistic, multi-layered and fully developed human beings: Theo, the narrator around whom all others spin; Boris, his chief sidekick who\\u2019s dragged all over the world by his abusive businessman father; Pippa, the girl Theo falls in love with just minutes before a bomb goes off in the New York Metropolitan Museum, setting the plot in motion; Hobie, who is kinder to Theo than anyone since his mother died in the explosion; and a cast of hundreds more. I can still vividly picture every one of these characters, though Tartt, thankfully, allows readers to fill in most of our own visuals\\u2014which is odd, considering she\\u2019s so heavy on other kinds of descriptions.<br/><br/>As both a reader and writer I\\u2019ve never been that interested in description, whether of city streets or country roads, lavish mansions or run-down hovels. Thus, Tartt\\u2019s long, detailed word paintings of whatever\\u2019s going on while what\\u2019s really going on goes on, annoyed the hell out of me\\u2014that is, for the first hundred pages or so, until I surrendered to her descriptive prose. Even when her descriptions are relevant, the plot is so engaging that I impatiently scanned the page (or rather Kindle screen), my nerves twitching with Come on, get to the story already! For instance, just as Boris is about to tell Theo (and us) what\\u2019s become of the treasured painting at the center of the plot, Tartt deviates from the conversation to let us know what\\u2019s playing on the barroom television! She also employs that famous plot device, or rather plot-avoidance device, the flashback: right after the explosion, Theo is crawling through a collapsed passageway seeking an exit, when Tartt flashes back to a time in his life when he was stuck in another small space.  Sometimes she even writes flashbacks within a flashback!<br/><br/>At such times I became distracted and annoyed, reading as quickly as possible to get past these...but then a funny thing happened on my way back to \\u201cthe story\\u201d: I began to notice that my impatience was similar to what happens when I\\u2019m reading suspenseful passages. Tartt\\u2019s long flights of description and flashback left me literally suspended. I wanted to know what would happen next: I had to turn the page. Are these devices, then\\u2014descriptions, flashbacks\\u2014purposeful techniques employed in order to create suspense? Are they what make the story so compelling? Perhaps. No, more than perhaps: probably.<br/><br/>It\\u2019s worth noting that The Goldfinch is only Donna Tartt\\u2019s third published novel, and that she spent eleven years writing it. At a time when authors attend workshops on \\u201cHow to Write A Bestseller in a Weekend\\u201d and toss off a book every six months, Tartt is holding down the fort of literary excellence.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u'Pure Gold'}\n",

Most physical injury heals. The same cannot be said of mental agony.<br/>The goldfinch painting  depicts a bird whose movements are limited by a short chain. Parallels can be drawn between a  beleaguered  young man chained down by circumstance, and the restriction of movement of a bird meant to fly free.<br/>I finished the book because of the fine writing and a need to plow through the gloom and doom to find out what happens next.

The story morphs from \"\"Great Expectations\"\" to a substance abuse \"\"Huck Finn\"\" to something like a Bret Easton Ellis novel about a high society con man to, finally, a Norwegian crime thriller, and (almost) each turn is as surprising as it is well-executed.<br/><br/>While I thought the final chapter played a bit too conventionally, and Tartt spends more pages than I\\'d like hammering the theme on the home stretch, her characters and the worlds built around them stay rich, complex, and singular enough to justify the hefty page count.

With very few exceptions, all scenes need to advance the plot, but Tartt has too many dialogue heavy scenes that go nowhere, esp. about drug use. She forgets that the reader does not need/want too many pages devoted to conversation for no reason.<br/><br/>The story itself is a good one, and the author has several very good turns and twists, but again, due to the excessive number of useless pages she writes, these narrative turns happen too far apart to make the story driving or exciting.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u'Far too long, not enough payoff'}\n",

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">Poor Donna Tartt.<br/><br/>It must be a curse when your first novel is such an undeniable masterpiece as \"\"The Secret History.\"\"<br/><br/>In a way, that brilliant debut novel has rendered Donna Tartt just as tethered and flightless as the poor trapped bird in the painting which is the centerpiece of her third book. \"\"The Goldfinch\"\" displays the agony of an author attempting to recapture the lightning in a bottle that she once caught, perhaps knowing herself that she is doomed to never experience that electricity again.<br/><br/>It is oddly prescient and ironic that the last words spoken by Richard Papen in the introduction of \"\"The Secret History\"\" are:  \"\"This is the only story I have to tell.\"\" Was Donna Tartt trying to tell us something?<br/><br/>There is no argument that the prose in \"\"The Goldfinch\"\" is exquisitely rendered, (although on occasion, a bit sophomoric.) Once again, the characters are vivid, complex, and intriguing. But while \"\"The Secret History\"\" proceeds in a seamless manner, gently and slowly opening to reveal a nearly perfect blossom, \"\"The Goldfinch\"\" is like a promising bud that never really blooms. It is a novel laden with an unaccountable \"\"Sturm und Drang.\"\" It\\'s a book so plot-driven that it almost seems like Ms. Tartt exhausted even herself in attempting to tie together the loose ends in the last quarter of this plodding novel. Simply put--the ending is not believable. In more than one instance, the plot violates one of the most basic tenets of good fiction:  The suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Most authors can be excused to employ one or two \"\"Deus ex Machinas\"\" to escape from painting themselves into a literary corner. But to use this device over and over again? This would be derided as bush-league writing from publishers if they were considering an author\\'s first novel. But sadly, even after eleven years, this is precisely the device Ms. Tartt employs and relies upon for the ending of her book, almost as if she was pulling an all-nighter on a writing assignment that needed to be handed in first thing in the morning.<br/><br/>I cannot give examples of the plot contortions, as numerous as they are, without the risk of spoiling the story. But I can say that you will recognize them when you read them. At times I found myself mesmerized, only to be jarred back to reality, akin to being awakened from a dream, the spell broken, thinking...\"\"What?\"\"<br/><br/>And rather than allowing the reader to absorb and reach his or her own conclusions, Ms. Tartt spends pages and time defining what can best be described as \"\"Existentialism 101.\"\" \"\"Bad things happen to good people...but we must look at the middle ground...enjoy the rainbows and beauty along the way, even if the endpoint of it all is death...but there is danger in beauty.\"\" Really Donna? Did I just spend 800 pages to learn what Friedrich Nietzsche explains in the first four paragraphs of \"\"Beyond Good and Evil?\"\"<br/><br/>Ms. Tartt does not seem to be maturing as a writer. Her characters, (and perhaps herself as well,) are caught in a permanent state of adolescence. They don\\'t seem to grow as much as they devolve. Again, the use of opiates and college-age high-jinx take center stage in this novel, page after page after page. No new ground is broken here. Much like the character Hobie, who takes bits and pieces of furniture to fake a \"\"real\"\" Chippendale, Donna Tartt assembles scraps of prose to try to construct a novel. Like Hobie\\'s fakes, where the grain and patina don\\'t quite match the real thing, neither does \"\"The Goldfinch\"\" ever elicit the beauty of an enduring work of art.<br/><br/>It\\'s striking how quickly and with such skill that a writer like Stephen King can churn these kinds of books out. (Granted, he did give this book a glowing review.) But this shouldn\\'t have taken eleven years! Mr. King would have been on his ninth novel in the same amount of time, with work as polished and well-constructed as most of his novels undeniably are, whether one is a fan or not.<br/><br/>I admit feeling like a traitor and a turncoat, because Donna Tartt has found a permanent place in my heart. She is an incredible genius, a power-packed intellect, a firecracker of the first order, living in the petite persona of a sweet and mysterious girl from Mississippi. But even her recent interviews have revealed a striking change. She is taking herself VERY seriously now.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, \"\"The Goldfinch\"\" is not the book that should have precipitated this change. It is most certainly not \"\"The Book of the Year.\"\" And sadly enough, there is no one more heartbroken about it than I.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u'Tartticide!'}\n",

Along the way we encounter an array of colorful characters and go for some wild rides. The characters are so vivid I find myself thinking about them even weeks after finishing the book. I am a big fan of Dickens and this book struck that chord for me, albeit in a modern sense. There are graphic and frequent drug references throughout so that may put some readers off.

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">What I loved about this book is the friendship between the protagonist, Theo, and his delightfully penned, dodgy Ukrainian/Polish mate Boris. The staging for the story - loss of Theo\\'s mother at 13 to a bomb in a museum and his subsequent acquisition of a world famous painting - is fascinating and compelling. The main premise of the novel, that the possession of one piece of extraordinary art can shape a man\\'s life, is intriguing. Theo\\'s relationships with his dead mother and his no-hoper father are also well-written. The narrative arc is strong and the story ended in a way that surprised me.<br/><br/>However, I did find it difficult to believe that Theo would accompany Boris on his madcap trip to Amsterdam, when he had spent all his life up to that point being incredibly careful. For me, the novel slightly unravelled from this point onwards, despite the fact that I enjoyed the final plot twist.<br/><br/>I have read most of the criticisms here in the reviews and find many of them far too harsh. There are copious descriptions of drug use (both legal and non-legal), but I felt they were justified. It seemed to me that part of the thrust of the storytelling is to give the reader a character who is both conventionally off-the-rails, but somehow still going about his life. Most fiction takes a very tedious line on drug use, characterising users as either baddies or victims. Theo is neither. This fascinated me.<br/><br/>The Goldfinch is a splendid work of fiction, with compelling (and sometimes entertaining) characters, a strong plot and an interesting message. It\\'s also a great read.

So rather than the actions and motives of the characters stirring us to our own philosophical musings, we have an overblown version of \"\"what it all means\"\" spelled out in evangelical tones.

In doing so, I picked up a copy of Donna Tartt\\'s, The Goldfinch, from my neighborhood book store. I didn\\'t know what to expect, but I had positive expectations given the reviews for the book. What I like about this book specifically is Tartt\\'s attention to detail. She describes Theo Decker\\'s (the protagonist) world in colorful detail, from his observations of other people to himself, his emotions, his sense of smell, etc... To write in such detail (and gracefully I might add) requires significant observatory skills by the author, and the ability to transform those observations into meaningful words which convey the essence of a story.

She is the closest thing to reading a Dickens sort of novel today with its density of characters and storyline, mysteries and details of the most minute and miracles of writing.  To read one of her books is to experience a travel that\\'s like no other. Reading \"\"The Goldfinch\"\" is like that.  It\\'s her best effort thus far, I think.  It\\'s simply the most amazing.  And, that doesn\\'t mean I don\\'t think you should read her other two books!<br/><br/>I found myself jumping up several times in glee and forcing my husband just to listen to small descriptions of the otherwise mundane in this novel.  She writes so beautifully that the union suit of a miner hanging on a bathroom shower curtain becomes iconic and gorgeous!  It actually is so real, it lives and breathes!!  Amazing stuff...so you can imagine how the rest of her story comes to life.  The repair and care of antique furniture becomes so precious and such an act of love, it reaches your soul.<br/><br/>Tartt\\'s characters are to love, hate, to sympathize with, to disparage, to want to reach out for.  They are pitiful, disgusting, harmful, harmless and worthy of your most tender feelings.  She runs the gamut.  You become fully engaged...it\\'s impossible not to.  They are so alive.<br/><br/>This is a story about relationships of all kinds: parenting, friendship, love.  There\\'s fear and selfishness and other emotions from basic relationships.  It\\'s a story of redemption and finding ones place in the world.  It\\'s an exploration of the world from many sides of life.<br/><br/>I will admit there is so much to take in in this novel that I couldn\\'t just sit down and read it fast like some books.  I had to take it in parcels.  I wanted to savor the words and the journey of its characters, particularly the primary one, Theo.  I\\'ve always felt that way about Tartt\\'s books.  They are the kind you don\\'t want to finish quickly because when you do, they\\'ll be all gone!  I hate to turn the last page.<br/><br/>I would welcome you on this journey of a special read.

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">This book is a failure on so many interesting levels.<br/><br/>First, Donna Tartt spent over a decade writing this book.  I did the math, and that breaks down to something like a single paragraph per week.  My problem with this is that ANYONE given eleven years should be able to write a novel of substance.  Because of the rarity of her output, this novel is being heralded as an important work and a big contribution to the literary world.  I\\'m not sure why, however, her inability to write faster or more often somehow automatically makes the quality of that output better.  So many terrific and brilliant writers working today produce a novel once a year; she, however, needs over a DECADE.  Which leads me to my next criticism.<br/><br/>One would think that with eleven years of reclusive struggle, the final work would be hugely imaginative.  Incredibly, however, this book, written by an art history major, is all about art, art history, paintings, forgeries, and even concludes with a numbing thesis on the purpose of art itself.  The experience, quite frankly, is like watching her masturbate in public.<br/><br/>As to the book itself: there is no plot.  I for one don\\'t necessarily need a plot per se, but the book goes out of its way to shape itself as a plot-oriented novel, and then all the plot points and threads and character issues are left completely and totally unresolved.  Theo\\'s crappy fiance, Pippa, Lucious Reeve, they all just STOP.  Since people keep comparing Tartt to Dickens--an astounding comparison given that Dickens was the closure master--I would liken the experience to reading Dickens\\' unfinished Edwin Drood.  He at least had a legitimate excuse for not finishing: he died.  Her characters, however, just STOP once the problem of the painting is resolved.  And this, finally, leads me to the biggest problem of the whole book:<br/><br/>WHY DIDN\\'T THE KID JUST RETURN THE DAMN PAINTING?  The whole books hinges on his keeping the painting; once that plot point becomes impossible to fathom, the book begins to feel like a waste of time.  For no reason I could discern, Theo tortures himself with the prospect of being caught and labelled as an art thief, but at ANY TIME he could have returned the painting, anonymously, and yet he doesn\\'t.  His decision not to strains all credulity; an amusement park of dinosaurs resurrected from the DNA of the blood contained in a petrified mosquito is more believable.  What\\'s more, I just didn\\'t care that he had the damn thing.  His ridiculous decision to risk his life to retrieve the thing also turns the novel into a preposterous and poorly written airport thriller without the thrills.  And once the painting takes center stage, the book, as others have pointed out, becomes plain boring.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the author\\'s detail in her prose.  And, indeed, the characters and details she creates do seem to be carved with tiny tools at a deeply minute and microscopic level.  However, detail aside, I was surprised at how little poetry the prose had.  It was workmanlike and the verbs were used correctly, but out of 800 pages, I can count on one hand the number of times I read something that resonated or sung.<br/><br/>This is not the worst book ever written, obviously.  The portion of the novel which occurs in Las Vegas is hugely engaging.  Following Theo to the tract-home wasteland of his life with his horrible dad was enthralling and certainly kept me guessing.  However, even then that portion only reminded me of Russell Banks\\' Rule of The Bone, a far superior work of fiction about a teenage boy and his travails.<br/><br/>I truly don\\'t get the hype, and I think the hype is offensive to more talented writers whose biggest sin is producing multiple novels before three full Olympic games have come and gone.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u'It took her HOW long to write this?'}\n",

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">Donna Tartt, without a doubt, is an exceptional writer. This book is filled with beautifully crafted sentences and paragraphs.  I enjoyed that aspect of the book and I think that was enough to warrant finishing this book but this was a close call.  The downside, for me, is that 770 pages of linguistic gymnastics starts to take its toll when the substance of the novel does not match the ornamentation in which it is delivered.  So many of the situations and inner thoughts of the protagonist just do not ring true and the number of threads that Ms. Tartt follows from start to finish begin to feel like an unravelling sweater that leave the emporer naked at the end.  I really endured the novel more than I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Many reviewers have covered the plot so no point in belaboring here.  I would note that the beginning feels like a Dickensian tale (death of a parent, child adrift and alone in society, sub-optimal caregivers) and then shifts clunkilty into the description of a very unlikeable adult who covets a painting.  I read dozens and dozens of pages about that painting without ever understanding why everyone who sees it is so covetous to possess it.

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">The Goldfinch is a novel of a boy who is given one of the world\\u2019s most famous paintings, by a stranger, during a terrorist attack.  It is also a book that vividly paints the idiom, \\u201cNo good deed goes unpunished\\u201d while adding the phrase, \\u201cand no punishment is without reward.\\u201d  The essence of the book is excellent.  When Ms. Tartt writes action, dialogue, plot points and descriptions of the locations within this book, there were few better books published this year.  This excellence, however, is often lost among the (seemingly) endless discourse of the narrator, Theodore \\u201cTheo\\u201d Decker, about the minutiae of an observation, memory, place visited or the present distraction suffered by the Hero.  The book would have been on par with Gone Girl were it 400 pages shorter, alas, it is almost 800 pages.<br/> Theo Decker\\u2019s father went to work one day and never returned.  They learned of his abandonment weeks after the fact when he contacted them.  His mother, already working to support the family, was making Theo\\u2019s life as full as possible when they stepped into a museum to escape a thunderstorm at the absolute wrong moment.  What occurs in the hour they were looking at the paintings was a moment that defined Theo\\u2019s life for the next 13 years (the duration of the book).  He lives with the family of a schoolmate, a wealthy New York Old Money clan that embraced him quickly.  When his father shows up to \\u201cclaim\\u201d him, he relocates to Las Vegas, where the safety, direction and care he knew in NYC is nonexistent.  He meets Boris, a Russian immigrate whose father is as dependable as is Theo\\u2019s; they are left to raise themselves.  Theo moves back to New York City in hopes of finding the life he once knew and any memories he can find of his mother.  In all these moves, he takes with him the painting handed to him during the disastrous museum visit.<br/>How an adolescent can keep a world famous painting safe and a secret, all the while worrying what to do with it, yet never considering returning it to the museum, is never addressed.  The issue of \\u201cwhat to do with MY painting\\u201d is so frequently raised that it becomes but one of the distractions of a plot that, eventually, fulfills the promise of being a fine story of life, friendship, fidelity, faith and destiny with a bit of mystery, intrigue and violence in the mix to give it flavor.  There is a moment of graphic violence, descriptions of violence done to a child and plenteous drug use within its pages.<br/>I doubt I will read another of Ms. Tartt\\u2019s books unless she finds an editor that knows her/his job.  There are too many words used to relate the story.  I felt, at points, that she was testing the editor (and reader) to see how much she could write that had little to do with the plot flow and it be included within the pages of this book.

I actually thought at the beginning it was from a female POV, I guess I must have missed something. Then I was surprised when I discovered this first-person voice was actually a male, and then that he was writing an account of things that had happened years before. It would have helped had I known that in the beginning, but like I said I could have missed it - I did find myself speeding through some things trying to get to the next \"\"thing\"\" happening and not wanting to read all the detail about dreams, drug highs, stupid things done as kids in Las Vegas (of which a lot could have been left out.)

You may be happy to have the narrator, Theo set off for breakfast with his mother but for me, I loose interest when, 10 pages later, they have only managed to progress from the apartment to the street.

How does Theo keep going for another ten years when, already aged 15 this slip of a youth seems to have lost everything except his hankering after drugs and pills ? His acceptance into his adopted family,even given they are mostly bonkers themselves (is anyone normal in NYC ?) is just as unbelievable as is Hobie\\'s extraordinary inclusion of Theo into his business, home and life.It\\'s all very American, so if, like me you have not watched the movies, or listened to the music or know New York, or been catatonic from drugs then like me, you will be lost.

All the characters that surround Theo are extreme and charismatic, and very describable, but Theo, the one to whom we are supposed to attach most is sort of a non-entity, a chameleon, who gravitates to bold characters and then appropriates their characteristics and interests.<br/>Rule number 1 for writing a great, epic, coming of age novel- create a memorable and lovable protagonist to hold it all together.<br/>I also thought it could have used better editing, someone should be steering Donna Tartt away from writing half her novel (in parenthesis.) It pulls the reader out of the reality of the story and draws their attention to the artifice of the novel, and when an adult female author is trying to write as an adolescent male, drawing attention to the authorial presence is the last thing you want to do.<br/>That said, I wouldn\\'t discourage anyone from reading the novel, but if you\\'re stuck on the proverbial island and only get to pick one, read The Secret History!<br/><br/>I\\'ve written a fuller review on my blog [...]</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u\"It's no Secret History\"}\n",
      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">Do writers think that length equals quality? Or is it simply their demand to be taken seriously? A lot of the books acclaimed this year have been very long ones. Some examples, just among those that I have read, have been THE LUMINARIES by Eleanor Catton (830 pages), THE WOMAN WHO LOST HER SOUL By Bob Shacochis (712 pages), NIGHT FILM by Marissa Pessl (592 pages), THE SON by Philipp Meyer (572 pages), and LIFE AFTER LIFE by Kate Atkinson (527 pages). All of these books had interesting qualities, but my enjoyment in each case (except possibly the Catton) was compromised by sheer length. Both Shacochis and Pessl piled incident on highly colored incident; the last generation in Meyer\\'s multi-generational epic was less interesting than the other two; and the open-ended structure of Atkinson\\'s extraordinary approach to story-telling could have been any length at all.<br/><br/>At 771 pages, this latest by Donna Tartt weighs in near the top of the class. But why wait ten years to write a book of this length, rather than publish two or three shorter novels in the same time? The entire story could easily have been a trilogy, and I could have enjoyed any one of the volumes separately, especially given its arresting opening. It first drew me into its orbit on page 22. Theo Decker, the 13-year-old protagonist, enters a New York exhibit of Dutch painting with his mother. Tartt\\'s writing, which had been serviceable up to that time, bursts into bloom with a glorious paragraph that exactly captures the luminous wonder of the Dutch Golden Age. Soon after that, the main plot kicked in, and we were away. The museum is targeted by a terrorist bomb. Theo\\'s mother is killed; he survives. But first comes a dazed encounter with a dying man in the rubble, who gives him a signet ring and an address to take it to, and entrusts him with the small painting by Carel Fabritius called \"\"The Goldfinch\"\" that had featured in the exhibition.<br/><br/>[SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH if you do not want to know any more about the plot, though the details below are minor ones.] I mentioned trilogy since the rest of the novel falls roughly into three phases, each relating to one of the things that Theo lost or gained on that day: his mother, the ring, and the painting. So the next 250 pages have to do with Theo\\'s life as an orphan, virtually adopted by a wealthy family on the Upper East Side. This certainly held my interest, but when Theo\\'s vanished father turns up to cart him off the Las Vegas, my attention began to flag. The middle section overlaps with the other two. It begins when Theo presents the ring at an antique store in Greenwich Village and meets the dead man\\'s partner, a furniture restorer called Hobie, a wonderfully sympathetic character, who brings the story to life whenever he appears. Under his loving tutelage, Theo learns the antiques business, and how to tell the real from the fake. But as we move into the last 300 pages of the book, following a gap of eight years, Theo\\'s life becomes increasingly dominated by his continued possession of the painting which, together with a series of foolish choices of his own, drags him down into a shady underworld without a moral compass.<br/><br/>For the huge book to work as a whole, you must have one or more of these things: a prose style that is a joy in itself, or an all-embracing formal structure, or a sequence of events that keeps you fascinated throughout, or character development that is consistent from beginning to end and traces some clear arc, or some major theme or moral payoff that makes the long journey worthwhile. Donna Tartt\\'s style seldom reaches to those heights, but in all fairness few of the writers I mention above are especially noted for their prose. Her roughly chronological organization is at least straightforward, but she does not have the tight control of Catton, and a lot of her material seems arbitrary. She keeps minor events coming without falling into the hyperactivity of Shacochis or Pessl, but moves too slowly in significant ways to maintain the necessary momentum, leaving several thickets of dead wood. I do think she created a very attractive character in the young Theo at first, but either I did not see the organic evolution into the man he becomes, or I simply did not want to stick with him as he falls into foolish, addictive, or criminal behaviors.<br/><br/>And as for the overriding moral, consider what he says near the end of the book: \"\"No one will ever, ever be able to persuade me that life is some awesome, rewarding treat. Because, here\\'s the truth: life is catastrophe.\"\" If you care to read 771 pages to reach that conclusion, go for it.

But she doesn\\'t know when to shut up. I\\'m sure she refused to truly hear her editor. Hey, she had a NY Times bestseller twenty years ago. It\\'s her book and she can go on and on if she wants. The reviewer in Time magazine was clearly in love with her, said he read her book, Secret History, five times, but he pointed out the obvious on The Goldfinch: it needed to be cut 10-15% (he was being kind). The story of the young accidental art thief was heart-tugging in the beginning. There were paragraphs that were so moving and profound that I wished I were reading a real book instead of my beloved Kindle, so I could dog ear the page and read it over and over (even years from now). It\\'s that good. Unfortunately there were more times when I wanted to shout at the author and tell her to get out of the story. I just finished the book and only gave it two stars, despite Tartt\\'s sometimes brilliant prose. The story died for me from midway on. Endless descriptions of hangovers, debauchery and blurred drug-induced images killed the pleasure of escaping into the characters lives. The ending was predictable, and though I think the author wanted it to be bittersweet.

And then of course there are the adult Theo\\'s relationships with women, all of which seem overly chaste and prim and bloodless (especially compared to his relationship with Boris)-- even when he professes otherwise.<br/><br/>There\\'s a lot of Great Expectations in this novel-- I can\\'t imagine it\\'s coincidence that one of the main characters is called Pippa-- and Tartt frequently uses Dickens beloved device of the happy coincidence to move the plot forward. Usually Tartt makes the device work, but there are other times where the plot twists seem plucked from a forgettable TV movie of the week.<br/><br/>The final chapter could also have used some heavier editing--\"\" philosophizing\"\" is a great way to end Theo\\'s story, but the chapter just drags on forever, like a well meaning guest who won\\'t stop saying goodbye.<br/><br/>I gave it 4 stars because it\\'s a really masterful story and the fairy tale quality makes it markedly different from so much of modern fiction.

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">Were the members of the Pulitzer Board on acid when they decided that The Goldfinch would get the crown? And didn\\'t they notice its editor must have been on strike--or smoking weed while relaxing under a tree? Who knows, they all might have been inspired by Theo, the novel\\'s narrator, a poster boy for addiction who swallows pills like M&amp;M\\'s.<br/><br/>And, actually, this novel is pretty much like a box of chocolates. You begin with the few good ones and then...<br/><br/>When I picked up the work and was informed that Donna Tartt spent ten years writing it, I imagined a Flaubertian author seeking \"\"le mot juste.\"\" And if there are moments when the work clicks, when psychological tension happens, when dream/nightmare and reality blend, there is also that moment when I wonder if the ten-year-writing story is not some publicity stunt. Some brainwashing, as some of the writing here is totally loose, adolescent and careless. My suspicions arise somewhat at the museum scene, when all collapses, including Tartt\\'s prose which drags on and on and on...And on...<br/><br/>But it begins so well! Is that how Tartt got the Pulitzer--on the first 50 pages of reading? It is undeniable that she\\'s a capable writer. But at some point, something happened. She either went into some kind of depression or into some substance dependency. To the point where you stop caring for the narrator, for he ends up deconstructing himself, becoming (un-becoming) a character with no character.<br/><br/>As for the characters that truly deserve care and attention, Tartt turns her back to them. Say, Andy, Theo\\'s genius little friend who seems as emotionally estranged from his own family as he is from his own emotions; Andy is such an intriguing character. What does Tartt do? Without revealing the plot, I\\'ll just say that she does next to nothing with that. There are points of reference here and there, and now and then, but these are but tiny grains of sugar in very troubled water. And why does she insist on Boris, a horrible, incoherent character, more animal than human, more rat than dog in his invasiveness? I honestly detest this personage, who manages to be at once ugly, boring, confusing, and cliched. The only way I would like him is if he were sculpted by pastry chefs on the Halloween Wars show on the Cooking Channel.<br/><br/>Are there interesting characters? Mrs Barbour is one of the better ones. Mom could have been fabulous, but is not there long enough. Hobbie and Pippa are just fairy tale decorations. Had Tatt concentrated her efforts on Andy, Mom, Mrs Barbour and done something with Hobbie, she might have deserved that Pulitzer. Instead, she makes us spend time with the wrong people. Instead, she adds others--bim, bam, boom!-- who pop out like mushrooms--fungus--after a two-week rain. Instead, she lets her verbal self indulgence get the better of herself. (Again, where was the editor? Snoring in a corner?) As for the flooding, pseudo-philosophical verbosity of the end, it is a total, total disaster.<br/><br/>In the end, The Goldfinch relentlessly kills what it could have been.

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">The Goldfinch may be described as an amalgam of Kerouac, Gaddis, and Salinger, with a Nietzschean tint, but it is nonetheless its own peculiar animal, a sprawling, meditative, and bizare tale that, mystifyingly, manages to penetrate a melancholic smog of narcotics and nihilism and emerge as an out and out romp. The novel is insightful, absurd, and inane in turns, but Ms. Tartt remains in control of the narrative throughout, and thus one can just as easily interpret the moments in which it seems to lose focus as evidence of Tartt\\'s performative exuberance.<br/><br/>\"\"Performance\"\" is the operative word in considering The Goldfinch, and as is so often the case with postmodern texts, the novel\\'s performance of performance is at the heart of both its success and its shortcomings. Insofar as I understand performance, it is not merely a matter of the novel\\'s adherence to the classic \"\"show, don\\'t tell\"\" imperative, but rather also has to do with its enacting, on the level of language, an affective experience of the phenomena/milieu the narrative is engaging at a given moment. (Gaddis\\' use of unattributed speech in A Frolic of His Own and Joyce\\'s fracturing of chronology, and perspective in Ulysses and Finnigan\\'s Wake are examples.) For the majority of the novel, Ms. Tartt does an exemplary job of instantiating the chaotic lassitude of Theo Decker in multi-rhythmic, alternately spartan and indulgent prose, this especially in the many moments in which he withdraws into lush, and inevitably lugubrious altered states. Tartt\\'s renderings of Theo\\'s mother\\'s experience of art are light-handed and touching, and the novel\\'s vision of the human condition is poignantly enfleshed in Theo\\'s failure to recognize in Boris\\' friendship proof of the possibility in the immediacy of human interaction of what he allows only for art objects, which is to say of authentic love, and a substantive connection to the beautiful.<br/><br/>The novel\\'s faults are mostly venial: it overindulges in dreams and descriptions of drug trips, has about a hundred pages of fat, and its ending reads like it was written by an author not quite confident that her readers would \"\"get it.\"\" The most substantive criticism I can level against it is that the meditative/philosophical moments aren\\'t quite integrated into the overall flow of the narrative, and thus sometimes read as though they are foreign inserts, rather than natural parts of the novel.<br/><br/>One wants, also, to criticize Tartt for rendering a supporting cast of thin, insubstantial characters, however just as the words are on the tip of his tongue, the matter of performance leaps once more to the fore, and he realizes that he would be wrong to make such a criticism, because, finally, The Goldfinch is presented to us as the missive of a narcissist, and its tragedy is that it is Theo\\'s solipsism that guarantees his disaffection and alienation. His articulation of the power of art and that power\\'s origin in love is spot on, and the sorrow we feel as we close the book has to do with what he misses: that the ground of human existence is the capacity for art and love, which is to say, the ability to respond to and recreate what is most real and immediate.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u'The Force of Words'}\n",

It follows the life of Theo Decker, who as a boy survives an explosion in an art museum that kills his mother, and many others. Injured and dazed, he escapes with a valuable and important painting. Throughout all that follows - life as a Park Avenue orphan, then as a delinquent on the streets of Las Vegas; then in New York again dealing antiques with a debilitating drug habit - Theo drifts as an impartial observer, certain only of death\\'s eventuality. Life means nothing except for one thing: his hidden secret, the stolen painting of a tiny chained bird that seems to point to some greater truth, which ties him to the final memories of his mother. When that, too, is finally lost, it seems Theo is lost as well...<br/><br/>Something I have always loved about Donna Tartt is her ability to touch on the darkness and reduction of the human spirit - and to make it seem okay and most of all, understandable.

But that\\'s not what concerns me today.)<br/><br/>OK, the narrator starts out by saying he is 27 years old and recalls events which happened 14 years earlier, correct?  Let us be generous and say it is 2013 in this critically acclaimed novel (although it must have been written and finished earlier than this year), and 14 years earlier when the narrator was 13 years old was, let\\'s see,  1999, right? (D\\'uh!) (I\\'ve found no indications that the narration starts out in the future!)  Everyone in this novel has a cellphone.  The 13 year old narrator has an iPod. The iPod was introduced by Apple in 2001.  There are references to Harry Potter.  OK, the first Harry Potter volume was published in 1997.  What about the reference to the shoe bomber? (2001 as well.) Las Vegas, we are made to understand,  is undergoing a housing crisis in 1999, abandoned homes, desert reclaiming developments, cheap rents (check yourself if that is true for the late 1990s.)  Well, at least the 1933 movie \"\"SOS Iceberg\"\" checks out, although how and where these 13 year old characters had heard of such an obscure film is not explained.<br/><br/>And if the narrative is indeed in the future and time remembered by the narrator now in 2013, then how many 13 year olds  today (or anyone?) would know or remember the shoe bomber of 2001?<br/><br/>More.  Theo\\'s Las Vegas pal is for an unexplained reason tri-national, Polish, Ukrainian and Russian.  Or is the reason to show his vast knowledge of obscenities in three and more (he\\'s widely traveled) languages?  You should savor the conversations between Theo and this Boris (or Borys in Ukrainian, as the author sees necessary to inform us), endless exchanges of eF words, and later on cryptic cellphone text messages (again in 1999, at the latest.)<br/><br/>You can mess with geography and weather in fiction. You can invent events, such as the museum bombing in this novel, invent cities and streets, businesses on existing streets,  but when you start messing with time, you\\'ve entered the science fiction category and even science fiction has its rules which this novel does not seem to observe.

Tartt spends entirely too many words describing things in several different ways, as if she\\'s impressed with her own ability to be descriptive. The characters are just hideous, with the exception of Boris who seems to know his shortcomings and presses ahead with a positive attitude. I found nothing to like about Theo: I never felt his pain and he was not in the least a redeeming soul. Theo only had one friend that he respected, Boris. Other than that, he was a drugged out selfish jerk to everyone else. The story is disjointed, going for hours and pages at a time to describe events that add nothing, nothing to the story.<br/><br/>What bothered me most is the title: The Goldfinch. It was not about the painting because it seems that Theo had no real interest in this painting, and for a great portion of the book, I had forgotten about the painting and so did the author and the main character<br/><br/>Tartt is a good writer and sought out to prove that she can \"\"paint\"\" a picture, but to me it was just a long waste of time for characters who were horrible, places I didn\\'t need to be taken to, and many story lines that were left dangling until the author reached the end of her thesaurus and decided to opine on her philosophy of life.<br/><br/>One note to audio listeners: I found the narrator to be overall good, but his voicing of Theo made the character seem self-indulgent, whiny, and not that intelligent.

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">Tartt\\'s triumphant masterpiece brings readers into the romantic modern cobbly streets of New York City, exposing the underworld of art theft, drug fueled adventure, and terrorism all coated with the bright polished sheen of modern anxieties.<br/><br/>It is an amazing book, and one that is difficult to compliment and study in a review without giving a fanboy\\'s dam-breaking flood of emotional \"\"squee\"\" resulting in my dear readers being spoiled of every element of the story from beginning to end. But I must attempt to review it, frustratedly scratching away at the plot as a drunk adolescent delicately scratches away at the newspaper, bubble wrap, and packing tape hiding his Fabritius masterpiece.<br/><br/>Erm... Well, that is in the first few pages, right? I mean...<br/><br/>Out of all of Tartt\\'s explorations into the golden haze that is adolescence, The Goldfinch is a triumph that blends modern thematic sensibilities with the classical humanness of existence. Many reviews I read of this book prior to reading it all suggested that it was akin to Great Expectations and many of the works of Dickens, for its style and bildungsroman attributes. Frankly, it took me a little while to warm up to this analysis given by many reviewers, but it is absolutely true. The Goldfinch features the building up of some tremendously dynamic three-dimensional characters, thrown together by circumstance and masterful plotting, into a tempest of energy and circumstance rooted in reality.<br/><br/>The delicate crafting of the writing in this piece is what sets Tartt above her peers in this book. Where we are not often graced by American masters - presumably because of the publishing industry\\'s overall lack of attention on the literary and more focused on the young adult and sexually charged romance/occult bestseller lists - we are given an amazing piece that ages its diction, tone, and complexity as our protagonist ages. I found myself highlighting minuscule phrases to giant chunks of text for each chapter as the book progressed. Where we have not seen a master like this akin to McEwan in the United States for some time - although some of our living masters have retired - Tartt is an extraordinary writer and storyteller whose Goldfinch is a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>I will be recommending this book to people for ages, as enthusiastically as I did for The Little Friend and The Secret History. But with those two books I had some little gripes. With Friend, it was the story lines that Tartt introduced but never followed through with to completion - which is ultimately realism defined, however vexing to an audience hungry to escape. With History, it was the uncomplicated easy-way-out of the last two pages - I enjoyed every sentence of that piece as well, but I felt that the ending was just a little too surprisingly out of character for the protagonist. Of course, I did the only sensible option by tearing out the last two pages, and we have been in business ever since.<br/><br/>Just kidding.<br/><br/>In all seriousness, The Goldfinch is perfect. It is a triumph of showcasing a reality of poverty, aging, love, addiction, modern anxieties, the love of art, humanness, violence, being American, truth, human behavior, and so much more. The book is a cat-crusher, but I find myself wishing I could have lived in it for another 750 pages. I will be revisiting it often, and musing on many of the same thematic elements in many of the same ways that Theo Decker did... Its beauty and reality cuts to the bone, and we are unlikely to see a piece with such an accurate emotional resonance to our generation than this for a very long time.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u'Unmistakable beauty, difficult to put down'}\n",

The characters are powerful, the writing is impressive, and Theo\\'s fall through life is heart-wrenching.  It all starts with a single, random, destructive event that will shape Theo\\'s entire life.<br/><br/> \"\"It happened in New York, April 10th, fourteen years ago.  (Even my hand balks at the date; I had to push to write it down, just to keep the pen moving on the paper.  It used to be a perfectly ordinary day but now it sticks up on the calendar like a rusty nail.)\"\"<br/><br/>I talk in some detail about the plot points here.  If you don\\'t want to be spoiled at all, just get it and start reading, it\\'s a great book.<br/><br/>The explosion and Theo\\'s escape is brilliantly written.  Tartt captures Theo\\'s confusion, disorientation and desperation with great realism.  Theo\\'s interaction with Welty, and witness of his death had me entranced.  Tartt managed to evoke deep empathy and connection with this man, essentially a stranger, by sharing the intensely personal final moments of his life.<br/><br/>And so begins Theo\\'s fall.  It seems to be arrested fairly quickly as the Barbours step in, but soon takes a turn for the worse as his father appears on the scene.  The sequence of callous actions taken by Theo\\'s father to sell his dead wife\\'s possessions, Theo\\'s failure to fight to keep his new and beautiful friendship with Hobie, and Mrs. Barbour\\'s seeming failure to raise objections to Larry Decker\\'s obvious unsuitability as a parent make for a chilling and depressing turn in the story.<br/><br/>Theo moves into Larry and Xandra\\'s huge empty house in a failed Vegas housing development, befriends misfit Boris, and begins his drug habit.<br/><br/> \"\"It seemed like the kind of room where a call girl or a stewardess would be murdered on television.\"\"<br/><br/>I found this incredibly hard to read, there\\'s something deeply disturbing about witnessing a promising young life slide inexorably towards disaster.  There reached a point when 14 year old Theo was having a thanksgiving dinner of stolen potato chips and vodka, getting drunk and watching the Macy\\'s Thankgiving Parade with Boris, that I began to despair of there being any good news or a chance for Theo to turn his life around.  Theo and Boris\\' drug experimentation felt rather Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas on a number of occasions.<br/><br/> \"\"\"\"Of course,\"\" said Boris, looking less and less like a person every moment, and more like some degraded piece of silver nitrate stock from the 1920s, light shining behind him from some hidden source.\"\"<br/><br/>Eventually there\\'s another big change that at least gets him out of Vegas, but his life begins to be ruled by the stolen painting, particularly his fear of discovery and jail-time for the theft.  He\\'s so afraid of Hobie discovering the painting that he only leaves the house in his company and spends most of his time indoors scarcely leaving his room.  Any hope I had that getting out of Vegas would set him back on the right track is soon crushed.<br/><br/>His trauma over the death of his mother, and years of mistreatment and neglect by his father have left him isolated and unable to relate to his peers, even when he does get back to something like normal schooling:<br/><br/> \"\"They lived at home with their parents; they worried about things like grade curves and Itailian Abroad and summer internships at the UN; the freaked out if you lit a cigarette in front of them; they were earnest, well-meaning, undamaged, clueless.\"\"<br/><br/>For a large part of the novel I found myself floundering around, desperately hoping for the hint of a happy resolution: that Theo and Pippa will be able to make a relationship out of two broken pieces, that Theo could make it as a legitimate antiques dealer.  While this deep emotional connection is the sign of a great novel, it was also intensely depressing and made for some difficult reading.<br/><br/>When Theo takes his international trip I felt like the person watching the horror movie yelling out \"\"Don\\'t go in there! Turn around!\"\", it was so obviously a terrible idea.  Having said that, I thought the ending was decent, there\\'s some resolution, but not too happy as to be out of character with the rest of the novel.<br/><br/>My main regret is that the details of art forgery and the international art-crime underground weren\\'t explored more, perhaps through Boris\\' point of view.  The glimpses we got from Theo were fascinating:<br/><br/> \"\"Short of black light or lab analysis, much of Hobie\\'s fudging wasn\\'t visible to the naked eye; and though he had a lot of serious collectors coming in, he also had plenty of people who would never know, for instance, that no such thing as a Queen Anne cheval glass was ever made.\"\"<br/><br/>A very impressive novel.  4.5 stars.<br/><br/>Read more of my reviews at g-readinglist.blogspot.com<br/><br/>Edit: added a spoiler warning.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u'Some books are read and easily forgotten.

Then, when we are in New York his lengthy descriptions of mother, doorman hailing a cab and then his observations from the cab(not once but twice and it was a very short cab ride) of people on the sidewalks and then his lengthy and overly detailed observation of the girl in the museum and then as he makes his way out of the rubble after the explosion he observes more than is necessary and more times than we need to read of, an extensive list of emergency responders, i.e., NYPD, FDNY, K-9, Rescue Operations Battalion, Hazmat, etc. etc. When I am only one chapter into a book and I\\'m already skimming lines and paragraphs and becoming really irritated with the writer, I wonder if it\\'s worth going on.

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">Donna Tartt surely must have based her story line on the symbolism of a bird, the goldfinch, which according to the ornithologist, Herbert Friedman, has several symbolic meanings - principally, death, resurrection, sacrifice, and the soul.  Another symbol, he says, is recovery from illness as a kind of resurrection.<br/><br/>All those symbols abound with intricate details in the long work of fiction involving an actual painting entitled The Goldfinch, by the Dutch artist, Fabritius.  It is probably no coincidence that Tartt begins the story with the death of Theo\\'s mother during the bombing of the museum where The Goldfinch has been displayed, similar to the actual death of Fabritius at the age of 32, in 1654, caused by an explosion of gunpowder.<br/><br/>Theo, at age 13, mourns his mother\\'s death and begins a life of incomprehensibly difficult circumstances, of questionable friendships, and of facing the consequences of drug addiction and illegal acts.  His happiness is less dependent on friends and family than on the painting, which he has stolen from the museum as he escapes from the fire and bombing.<br/><br/>Tragic deaths occur, one after the other - his mother, his father, his friends.  His life of drugs and lies is one of little  hope.<br/><br/>Positives:<br/>Tartt displays vast knowledge of artists and writers, of various cultures and foreign languages.  Her narrative is fluid and easy to read.  The transition from one tragic incident to another actually piques the readers\\' interest.  We wonder how it will all end.  What will be the final outcome for Theo?  So, in a sense, it is tantamount to suspense and we read on and on for the answer.  The answer, it seems, is in the spiritual resurrection of Theo\\'s mind and soul.  Not his actions.<br/><br/>Negatives:<br/>Yes, we read on and on.  Tartt\\'s novel could have been GREAT, not just good, if she had reduced the number of pages by about 300 pages.  It was an arduous task to read the long conversations and descriptions of past events, many repetitive.  I skimmed over many pages.  The excessive verbiage left little to the readers\\' imagination.  In the end, Theo\\'s spiritual resurrection may have occurred, but his actions leave one thinking that his life is hopeless.

Some elements are so Dickensian (not to mention the broad picaresque sweep of the narrative) that they seem plucked from the 19th century and jarringly anachronistic when juxtaposed with terrorist bombings, cell phones, and the like. The main \"\"maguffin\"\" driving the narrative--that a teenage boy is obsessed by a small, intimate, 17th-century masterwork that by a freakish twist of fate comes into his possession--is more than a bit of a stretch. And parts are admittedly a bit overwritten and repetitious. However, if you allow yourself to go along for the ride, the vivid depictions of place; the intricate interactions of the characters; the eventful story irresistibly propelled by the quirks of personality and the mysterious workings of destiny; and raw, insightful musings on what it all can possibly mean are absorbing, compelling, and extremely poignant.

This work contains a kernel of a great story in need a a heavy edit job.  The basic tenant - life is short and some people can enjoy it more by appreciating art  that transcends the canvas (or whatever medium contains it greatness) is a simple, but good theme.  The story starts well, with a literal BANG, but meanders for too long until it it completely changes in the 4th (yes 4th!) act climax and then ends with a demount that is murky and unclear at best.  It leaves too many plot holes untied for the casual reader.  Some people will say this is purposefully done as a masterwork, but I don\\'t agree.  This is a good novel, with a lot of passages where you are TOLD (sometimes for 50 pages) and not shown.  Those are primarily thesis level discord on life and art. Interesting for the naval gazer, but not for the common novel reader. Is Donna a hack? No, she is a good writer, with very important things she wants to say.

The relationship between Theo and his mother, the bombing, and scenes of New York are so well written; the reader is pulled into what is bound to be a fascinating and interesting ride.

Enter Boris, a Ukrainian teenager who definitely adds a new element into the story, mainly drugs.  And it is here, the story begins to drag and the reader wonders where are is this going?<br/><br/>From Las Vegas back to New York, from an unsupervised teenager to a antiques dealer, from New York to Amsterdam the story takes some convoluted and sometimes not quite believable turns.  Boris reenters along with a totally new mystery and once again the story picks up speed.  There is no doubt this is a well researched and well written novel, but sometimes it\\'s just a bit too much.  The final pages take a philosophical turn with Theo providing a thesis of sorts on life, fate, and art.  Unfortunately, by this time, I was just ready for it to be over.

I was impressed with her originality and ability to use the language and straightforward observations of the streetwise morality of our times without hesitancy or apology.  The entire story is told in the first person by the principal protagonist, Theodore Decker, first introduced to us in Amsterdam as a mature man in a hotel room at Christmas time.  He recalls and tells us the story of his life and (we slowly learn) why he is there,  beginning  as a dependent thirteen year old boy suddenly thrust into the necessity of fending for himself by the sudden death of his mother under unusual circumstances and of what happens to him following that.  We slowly realize that he has a philosophy of life that is changing while affected by the necessity of coping with the happenstance of how he has survived  through interactions with those he meets and depends upon for care, friendship and some of whom may also take advantage of his weaknesses or circumstance.  The Goldfinch of the title is the subject of the small painting by Fabritius that resides in the collection of the Museum at the Hague.  It is cleverly used as a  measure  of the character for  key individuals  in the story.

First let me say something good:  The story line was original and had great potential.  Now for what is wrong with this novel:  The Author could have had a really enjoyable and insightful book if she had only learned somewhere along the way to not describe every random, obsessive thought the protagonist had.  Really!  Page after page describing how he felt when he looked at someone walking down the street, or gazing into a restaurant window, or any other mundane moment not related to the story.  Not to mention reliving the pivotal moment in his life over and over and over and over, ad invent um.  At half-way into the book I finally just gave up on reading each page and would skim and turn a page until I got to some relevant dialogue or action.  This book should have been half its size, and it would have been a 5 starred book.

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">Sent from my iPhone<br/><br/>Begin forwarded  But that afforded the author plenty of time  to hook me and she did not.:<br/><br/>From: frisson310@gmail.com<br/>Date: May 16, 2014, 7:29:33 AM EDT<br/>I read \"\"The Secret History\"\" years ago and liked it and I think somewhere in the tsunami of words that is \"\"The Goldfinch\"\" there\\'s a good 300-page book. But in its current form, I found it unreadable. Donna Tartt does have a way with words, I will give her that, but she needs to be told by somebody when to rein it in and \"\"murder her darlings.\"\" Unfortunately these days, publishers with an eye on the bottom line, simply don\\'t shell out money on editors. Many of my issues could have been so easily rectified by the blue pencil marks of a good editor.<br/><br/>Okay, I admit I only read the first part through the catastrophe at the Metropolitan Museum. That afforded the author plenty of time to hook me, but she patently did not. I couldn\\'t continue; it was just so poorly written.<br/><br/>People may think I am overly picky, but I consider myself a well-qualified critic having grown up in New York City enjoying a life quite similar to Theo, fortunately, without the tragedies. I am also an art historian and a writer.<br/><br/>\"\"The Goldfinch\"\" has been hailed as great literature and even won the Pulitzer Prize! Shouldn\\'t such an award be reserved for excellence?<br/><br/>It\\'s no wonder in recent years I have become very cynical about prizes, reviews and ratings, having seen in recent years overly favorable New York Times reviews written by writers I know to be the authors\\' friends. Corruption seems to be everywhere these days.<br/><br/>I believe reading a book of this ilk should be effortless, like you\\'re driving down a road and it\\'s smooth sailing all the way. There shouldn\\'t be all these bumps along the way causing you to slam on the brakes. You shouldn\\'t notice the writing at all unless it\\'s something that stops you in your tracks because it\\'s so beautifully expressed, or there\\'s an occasional word you need to look up. While I think digressions can be an effective conceit, experiencing two significant ones in the paltry part I did read, made me suspect that  during the course of the novel, Tartt was going to overuse them. Her ungainly scaffolding and ornate wordsmithery was all too apparent for me and I felt like I was slogging through a morass.<br/><br/>Other specific complaints:<br/><br/>Tartt talks about how precarious Theo and his mother\\'s finances are and yet they live in a doorman building in Sutton Place, take cabs everywhere and seem to eat out all the time.<br/><br/>Would she really have gone into the Metropolitan Museum, which opens at 10 when she had an important appointment with her son\\'s principal across town at 11:30? Much less waste time at the gift shop buying a book for her boss (I know she actually never got there, but she was planning to.) And Tartt obviously hasn\\'t been buying art books; they are hardly \"\"inexpensive.\"\"<br/><br/>Nobody in New York refers to the subway as \"\"the train\"\" it\\'s \"\"the subway.\"\"<br/><br/>After the explosion, Tartt describes Theo trying to locate train fare--Hello? It would be a Metrocard. Theo suggests getting a Metrocard as a gift for Mathilde so why wasn\\'t Tartt consistent?<br/><br/>Tartt also mentions him taking the train to school. Would he really take the train from East 57th Street to the Upper West Side? Far more likely, he\\'d take a crosstown bus and transfer to an uptown bus (or possibly a subway at that point). And he\\'d have a student Metrocard, which would save his mother a bundle.<br/><br/>The boy\\'s conversation with his mother and thoughts and observations about her work at a fashion PR firm were completely unbelievable. He\\'s supposed to be a 13-year old boy, give him the voice, thoughts and mannerisms of a 13-year old boy! During That whole section Tartt seemed to be grandstanding about how much she knows about the fashion world.<br/><br/>I find the reference to a \"\"school on the Upper West Side\"\" overly coy. Just name it, or make up a name. She\\'s names the Lyc\\xe9e Fran\\xe7ais after all. And Theo certainly wouldn\\'t refer to it as \"\"my school on the Upper West Side\"\" when talking to the old man.<br/><br/>The death of the old man was excruciatingly long (not in a you-are-there way; in a boring and overly-lengthy way) and repetitive. Tartt could have accomplished so much more with so much less. I suggest she read \"\"Atonement\"\" for tips on astringent, powerful prose.<br/><br/>She overused words that tend to jump out at the reader like \"\"loitering\"\" and \"\"grappling.\"\" Does Tartt not own a Thesaurus? It would be so easy to substitute synonyms...<br/><br/>While I thought her observations about the paintings were interesting, I couldn\\'t shake the feeling that she was showing off and didn\\'t quite believe the way Tartt\\'s mouthpiece, the mother, was talking to her young boy.

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">This is the first review I have ever  written . I am doing this because I make decisions based on reviews and this was probably the worst reading decision I have ever made.  I was totally mislead by it popping up as a \"\" you might also like..\"\"  In addition a friend who heart Donna Tartt interviewed on NPR was struck by her literacy and taste.  So he bought this for me, as a present. I guess we kind of thought it might be about art.  Haha.  I had  read that the horrific stuff at the beginning went on a little long, which it did , but then there was a continuous stream of dysphoria- forget the terrorist attack, okay that is over, but now it is alcoholism, child abuse, drug addiction, gambling, shady rooms full of drug dealers, lots of vomit and blood, sick scenes of suburbia  and more people dying . And virtually every character, save two maybe three, are nasty people you cannot imagine spending time learning about.  Why I kept reading is beyond me. I just wanted it to be over and it kept going on.  I was hoping it would get a bit more upbeat and all it did was get deeper into misery.  I don\\'t like reading fluff, and sadness and misery can be essential to a real story;  maybe the \"\"philosophy\"\" of it all, which people liked to highlight, was over my head but all I can say is I wish someone had told me to stay away</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u'Stay away'}\n",

Her use of language, dialects, and her ability to make characters (mostly) completely believable is astonishing.<br/>The Goldfinch is a story about a young boy, Theo Decker who was a victim of a homegrown terrorist attack in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  He is one of two survivors who we know of.  But his beloved mother died in the carnage.  Theo\\'s father had abandoned him and his family was non-involved leaving him alone but for the largess of a friend\\'s family.  Unbeknownst to anyone, Theo smuggled a small, but great work of art from the museum.  Had he given it back right away, there most likely wouldn\\'t have been any consequences.  But he didn\\'t know how to go about returning it, or, more likely, didn\\'t want to return it, and the consequences of not doing so are the meat of this story.<br/>In attempt to recover the painting, which was stolen from him, Decker gets involved with people he knows aren\\'t good for him, without really knowing that anyone knows what they\\'re speaking about.<br/>Decker has a moral core, despite doing some horrible things, and tries to make amends when and where he can.  But he\\'s too smart to behave as foolishly as he does, and the last third of the book, from the time a childhood friend of his resurfaces, the plot becomes convoluted and you stop caring for the protagonist.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u'Intriguingly Quirky'}\n",

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">The Goldfinch taught me a lesson---don\\'t buy a book based on the title alone.  My love of art history and stories seen through the eyes of youth, had me hoping for a really great read.  What I got was a most graphic \\'picture\\' of drugs, despair, and abuse.  I made it to the bitter end, but feel I slogged through endless suffering to get there.  The bones of a good story were there, but the author ruined it for me with excessive descriptions of misery.

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">There are only a hand full of books that have stayed with me long after I have read it - I call them WOW books because after you read the last page and close the book for the last time you sit for a moment sad that its over and the only word that conveys your feelings is - WOW! The masterpiece is not the painting of the Goldfinch but rather the masterpiece of the characters and settings painted by the words of Donna Tartt. Be forewarned this book is not for everyone this is literary fiction so if you are looking for a fast paced shoot\\'em up who dunnit  this book is not for you. However if you want to experience a story that is so well written you feel emotionally part of the hero and scenery so vividly written you can actually feel you are there then buy this book. I was so engrossed in the story I felt that Theo Decker was a part of me I felt his heartaches and feelings of desperation.

      "{'review': u'\"<span class=\"\"a-size-base review-text\"\">After an incredible start, it was a steep and LOOOOOONNNG decline towards the finish. What a slog. A most maudlin and BORING protagonist who never really SAYS anything, even in the limited dialog this book offers. It\\'s first-person, so the real action takes place elsewhere -- because our character is so dull and never does much -- and is reported second-hand to him. The best friend is sketched out like a cartoon character, and Theo describes his every mannerism in detail, how his friend eats, drinks, walks, talks, etc., but  the object of his affection is never fully sketched out for the reader, making it impossible for us to feel as if we know her. I swear the author drew on Bullwinkle for the character of Boris, and various Wes Anderson films for the Barbours. Tartt gets sloppy with details at the end, as she attempts, finally, to wrap-up this interminable tale of a morose, navel-gazing young man. Are we meant to feel sympathy for Theo because of the tragedy he endures? Because before I was halfway through this tree killer I started to loathe him. I am still not even finished with this cinder block. How often does a good book keep you up late when you know you are nearing the end? This is not it. I am crawling to the finish two or three pages at a time before I doze off. And each night, as I do, I think that I need to get an Amazon review out on this tragedy of a good idea, so tepidly executed. Ms. Tartt has killed any initial interest I had in her character. And I did many double takes with her inconsistent description of the limited action scenes in this book -- which actually managed to keep me awake. She had a kernel of a great idea here, but killed it by destroying any empathy one might have for her dull main character, who showed so much promise in the early going. Go read \"\"The Catcher in the Rye.\"\" It\\'s about 1/4 as long as this and at least we feel like we actually KNOW Holden.</span>\"', 'score': u'1.0', 'title': u\"How I spent my summer vacation, and I'm not happy about it\"}\n",

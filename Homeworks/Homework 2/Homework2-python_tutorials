Make jupyter python 2 notebook pages that teaches:

A. The difference between python lists and tuples
Lists are collections of data … more often homogenous or of more limited ranges of types. 
The notion of tuple as a “record type” … sort of a lightweight object with attributes but no methods 
The difference between list and tuple is that lists are mutable and tuples are immutable.

Show how to use them in:
1) if statements
2) for loops
3) lambdas
be sure to demonstrate mutablity or immuability and issues that can be created

B. Use of dictionaries

1) creation of dict
2) access, modify, and delete dict items
3) merge dictionaires
4) loop over

  i. keys
  ii. values
  iii. Items

For more than 3 points you can add meaningful sections to the two pages
and create more pages on other interesting aspects of basic python, for example random functions, regexp, map/reduce, file manipulations...
Be sure to name your file
LASTNAME_HOMEWORK2_LIST_AND_TUPLES_TUTORIAL_Fall_2017.ipynb
LASTNAME_HOMEWORK2_DICTIONARY_TUTORIAL_Fall_2017.ipynb
You can upload the files or the zip of all the files.
Or put them in your homework directory in your big-data-python-class  
github repo and send me the url in the submissions or both.
